  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Top Diagram:** The word \"wounded\" is contained inside a single closed oval curve. The word \"man\" is located outside to the left of this curve.\n*   **Bottom Diagram:**\n    *   The word \"man\" (on the far left) is outside all closed curves.\n    *   The word \"wounded\" is inside the largest, outermost closed curve.\n    *   The word \"disgrace\" is inside a middle-sized closed curve, which is itself inside the largest curve.\n    *   A second instance of the word \"man\" is inside the smallest closed curve, which is inside the middle curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   **Top Diagram:** A thick horizontal line connects the word \"man\" (outside) to the word \"wounded\" (inside).\n*   **Bottom Diagram:**\n    *   A thick horizontal line extends from the outer \"man\" on the left into the largest oval.\n    *   This line terminates at a vertical bracket or brace shape.\n    *   The bottom of this bracket extends toward the word \"wounded.\"\n    *   The top of this bracket connects to a horizontal line linking the inner \"man\" and the word \"disgrace.\"\n    *   There is a direct horizontal line connecting the inner \"man\" to \"disgrace.\"\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   **Top Diagram:** The connecting line between \"man\" and \"wounded\" crosses the boundary of the oval surrounding \"wounded.\"\n*   **Bottom Diagram:**\n    *   The line originating from the outer \"man\" crosses the boundary of the largest, outermost curve.\n    *   The short line connecting the inner \"man\" to \"disgrace\" crosses the boundary of the smallest, innermost curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   **Top Diagram:** There is no nesting; there is only one closed curve.\n*   **Bottom Diagram:** There is a three-level nested structure.\n    1.  A small oval (containing \"man\") is nested inside a medium oval.\n    2.  The medium oval (containing \"disgrace\" and the small oval) is nested inside a large outer oval.\n    3.  The large outer oval contains \"wounded\" and the medium oval.",
