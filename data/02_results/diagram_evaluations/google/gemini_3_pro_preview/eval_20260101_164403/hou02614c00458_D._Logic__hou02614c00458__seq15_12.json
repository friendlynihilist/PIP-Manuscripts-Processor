  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   The text label **\"wounded\"** is contained inside a closed, oval-shaped curve.\n*   The text label **\"man\"** is located outside of this closed curve, positioned to the left.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   The text label **\"man\"** is connected to the text label **\"wounded\"** by a horizontal line.\n*   This connecting line extends from the end of \"man\" into the beginning of \"wounded.\"\n*   There is a thick, dark, scribbled segment on the connecting line located between the two words.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   Yes, the connecting line crosses the left boundary of the closed curve to reach the text inside.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   No closed curves are nested inside others. There is only one complete closed curve visible.",
