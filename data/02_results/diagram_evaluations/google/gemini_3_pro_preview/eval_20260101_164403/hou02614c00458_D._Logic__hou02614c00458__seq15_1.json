  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram, here are the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **\"man\"**: Located outside of all closed curves.\n*   **\"disgraced\"**: Located inside the smaller, inner closed curve. Consequently, it is also inside the larger, outer closed curve.\n*   **\"wounded\"**: Located inside the larger, outer closed curve but outside the smaller, inner closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line extends from the right side of the word **\"man\"**.\n*   This line connects to the center of a bold, C-shaped or bracket-like curve.\n*   The top arm of this C-shaped curve extends toward **\"disgraced\"** and appears to merge with or touch the boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   The bottom arm of the C-shaped curve extends underneath **\"disgraced\"** and points toward **\"wounded\"**.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line connecting **\"man\"** to the C-shaped bracket crosses the left boundary of the larger outer closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is a smaller closed curve (encircling \"disgraced\") nested completely inside a larger closed curve (which encircles both \"disgraced\" and \"wounded\").",
