  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outside:** The text label \"man\" on the far left is located outside of all closed curves.\n*   **Inside Large Curve:** There is a large, elongated closed curve. Inside this curve are the text labels \"disgracer\" (top right), \"wounded\" (bottom right), and a second instance of \"man\" (top left).\n*   **Inside Small Curve:** There is a smaller, roughly circular closed curve located within the larger curve. The second instance of the text label \"man\" is contained within this smaller curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   **Main Branching Line:** A thick, dark line originates from the \"man\" label on the far left. It extends to the right and splits into two branches:\n    *   **Upper Branch:** Curves upward and connects to the \"man\" label inside the small circle.\n    *   **Lower Branch:** Curves downward and connects to the \"wounded\" label.\n*   **Internal Connection:** There is a short horizontal line or dash connecting the \"man\" label inside the small circle to the \"disgracer\" label to its right.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The line originating from the external \"man\" crosses the left boundary of the large outer curve to enter the shape.\n*   The upper branch of the line appears to cross or merge with the boundary of the small inner curve to connect with the text inside it.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The small, roughly circular closed curve containing the word \"man\" is nested completely inside the left side of the larger, elongated closed curve.",
