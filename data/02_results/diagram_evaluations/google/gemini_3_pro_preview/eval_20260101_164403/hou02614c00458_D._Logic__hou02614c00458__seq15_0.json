  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outside:** The text label \"man\" is located outside of the large outer closed curve, positioned to its left.\n*   **Inside Outer Curve:** The text labels \"many disgraced\" and \"wounded\" are contained within the large outer closed curve.\n*   **Inside Inner Curve:** The text label \"many disgraced\" is enclosed within a smaller, oval-shaped closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A thick, dark line connects the text \"man\" to the text inside the curves.\n*   This line splits into two branches after entering the large curve:\n    *   An upper branch extends upward to connect directly to the text \"many disgraced.\"\n    *   A lower branch curves downward to point towards or connect to the text \"wounded.\"\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The main line originating from \"man\" crosses the left boundary of the large outer closed curve.\n*   The upper branch of the line crosses the bottom boundary of the smaller inner closed curve to reach the text \"many disgraced.\"\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The smaller oval curve surrounding \"many disgraced\" is nested entirely inside the larger outer closed curve.",
