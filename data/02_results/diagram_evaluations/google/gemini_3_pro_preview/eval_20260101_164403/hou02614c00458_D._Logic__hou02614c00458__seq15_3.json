  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram, here are the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inner Curve:** A smaller, roughly oval-shaped closed curve contains the text labels **\"man\"** and **\"disgraced\"**.\n*   **Outer Curve:** A larger, roughly rectangular closed curve contains the text label **\"wounded\"**. It also completely encompasses the inner curve and its contents (\"man\" and \"disgraced\").\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   **\"man\"** and **\"disgraced\"** are connected by a short horizontal line situated between them.\n*   A vertical line descends from the center of the line connecting \"man\" and \"disgraced.\"\n*   This vertical line connects to a longer lower horizontal line.\n*   The right side of this lower horizontal line leads into the word **\"wounded\"**.\n*   The left side of this lower horizontal line extends outward to the left, ending in open space.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The lower horizontal line extending to the left crosses the left boundary of the **outer closed curve**.\n*   The vertical line connecting the upper text to the lower text crosses the bottom boundary of the **inner closed curve**.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The smaller closed curve (containing \"man\" and \"disgraced\") is nested entirely inside the larger closed curve.",
