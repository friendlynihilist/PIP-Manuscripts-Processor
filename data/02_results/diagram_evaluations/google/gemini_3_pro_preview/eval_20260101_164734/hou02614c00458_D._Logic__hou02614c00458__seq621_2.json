  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram, here are the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outer Closed Curve:** Contains the text labels \"catholic\", \"adores\", and \"woman\".\n*   **Inner Closed Curve:** Contains the text labels \"adores\" and \"woman\". The label \"catholic\" is outside this inner curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   The label \"catholic\" is connected to \"adores\" by a short horizontal line.\n*   The label \"adores\" is connected to \"woman\" by a short horizontal line.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line connecting \"catholic\" and \"adores\" crosses the left boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   A thick, dark, diagonal line segment on the far right side crosses the boundaries of both the inner and outer closed curves.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There are two closed curves (elongated ovals). The smaller curve is nested entirely within the right side of the larger curve.",
