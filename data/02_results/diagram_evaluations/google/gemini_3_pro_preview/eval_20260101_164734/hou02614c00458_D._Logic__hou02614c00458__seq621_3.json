  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside the closed curve:** The text label \"wounded\" and the bottom instance of the text label \"man\" are enclosed within the irregular loop.\n*   **Outside the closed curve:** The top instance of the text label \"man\" is located outside the loop to the left.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line connects the top \"man\" to \"wounded\".\n*   A vertical line branches downward from the center of that horizontal line, connecting it to the bottom \"man\".\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   Yes. The horizontal line connecting the top \"man\" (outside) to \"wounded\" (inside) crosses the left boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   No. There is only one single closed curve visible; no curves are nested inside others.",
