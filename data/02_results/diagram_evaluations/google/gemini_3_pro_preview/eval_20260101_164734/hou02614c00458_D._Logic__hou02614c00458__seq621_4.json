  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here are the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT:**\n*   **Inside:** The text label \"man\" (the lower instance) and the text label \"wounded\" are contained within the single elongated closed curve (oval).\n*   **Outside:** The text label \"man\" (the upper instance) is located outside and above the closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n*   There is a horizontal dash extending to the right from the upper \"man\" label.\n*   Inside the oval, a horizontal line extends to the right from the lower \"man\" label.\n*   A thick vertical line descends from the upper area and intersects the horizontal line coming from the lower \"man,\" forming a perpendicular (inverted \"T\") junction.\n*   The label \"wounded\" is positioned to the right of this junction, aligned horizontally, but is not connected to the other elements by a visible line.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n*   The thick vertical line crosses the top boundary of the closed oval curve, starting outside and ending inside.\n\n**NESTING:**\n*   There are no nested closed curves. There is only one single closed loop.",
