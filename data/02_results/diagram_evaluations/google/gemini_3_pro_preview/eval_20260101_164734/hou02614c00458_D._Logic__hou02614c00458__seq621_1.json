  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram, here are the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outer Closed Curve:** Contains the text labels \"catholic\", \"adores\", and the left instance of \"woman\".\n*   **Inner Closed Curve:** Contains the text labels \"adores\" and the left instance of \"woman\".\n*   **Outside:** The rightmost instance of the text label \"woman\" is outside both closed curves. \"catholic\" is inside the outer curve but outside the inner curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line connects the word \"catholic\" to the word \"adores\".\n*   The line continues, connecting \"adores\" to the inner \"woman\".\n*   The line extends further to the right, connecting the inner \"woman\" to the outer \"woman\".\n*   Effectively, all four text elements are linked in a single linear chain from left to right.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The line connecting \"catholic\" to \"adores\" crosses the left boundary of the inner nested curve.\n*   The line connecting the inner \"woman\" to the outer \"woman\" crosses two boundaries: first the right boundary of the inner curve, and then the right boundary of the outer curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is a smaller, roughly oval-shaped closed curve nested completely inside a larger, more elongated closed curve. The nested curve is positioned within the right-hand side of the larger curve.",
