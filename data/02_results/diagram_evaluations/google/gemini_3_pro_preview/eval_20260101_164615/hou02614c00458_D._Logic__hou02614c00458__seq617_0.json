  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram, here are the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outer Closed Curve:** Contains the text labels \"man\", \"American\", and \"respects\". It also contains the smaller closed curve and all drawn lines.\n*   **Inner Closed Curve:** Contains only the text label \"respects\".\n*   **Relative Position:** The labels \"man\" and \"American\" are inside the outer curve but outside the inner curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line connects the area immediately following the word \"man\" to the area immediately preceding the word \"American\".\n*   Two vertical, slightly curved lines extend upward from this horizontal line.\n*   These vertical lines connect the horizontal line to the left and right sides of the inner closed curve (the one containing \"respects\").\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   No lines appear to cross through the boundaries of the closed curves.\n*   The vertical connecting lines terminate at the boundary of the inner curve rather than passing through it.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   Yes, there is nesting. The smaller closed curve containing \"respects\" is nested entirely inside the larger, wider closed curve.",
