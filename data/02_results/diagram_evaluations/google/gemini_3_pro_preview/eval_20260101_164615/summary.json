It also contains the smaller closed curve and all drawn lines.\n*   **Inner Closed Curve:** Contains only the text label \"respects\".\n*   **Relative Position:** The labels \"man\" and \"American\" are inside the outer curve but outside the inner curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line connects the area immediately following the word \"man\" to the area immediately preceding the word \"American\".\n*   Two vertical, slightly curved lines extend upward from this horizontal line.\n*   These vertical lines connect the horizontal line to the left and right sides of the inner closed curve (the one containing \"respects\").\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   No lines appear to cross through the boundaries of the closed curves.\n*   The vertical connecting lines terminate at the boundary of the inner curve rather than passing through it.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   Yes, there is nesting. The smaller closed curve containing \"respects\" is nested entirely inside the larger, wider closed curve.",

The dash extending from \"man\" stops just outside the oval's perimeter, and the dash extending from \"wounded\" is entirely contained within the oval.\n\n**NESTING:**\n*   There is only one closed curve present, so there are no nested curves.",
