  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outer Curve:** A large, elongated closed curve contains the text labels \"man\", \"respects\", and \"American\".\n*   **Inner Curve:** A smaller closed curve is located in the center. It contains only the text label \"respects\".\n*   **Relative Position:** The labels \"man\" and \"American\" are inside the outer curve but outside the inner curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line connects the text \"man\" on the left to the text \"respects\" in the center.\n*   A thicker horizontal line connects the text \"respects\" in the center to the text \"American\" on the right.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The line connecting \"man\" and \"respects\" crosses the left boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   The line connecting \"respects\" and \"American\" crosses the right boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   No lines cross the boundary of the large outer curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The smaller closed curve surrounding \"respects\" is fully nested inside the larger closed curve.",
