  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   The text label **\"wounded\"** is contained inside a single, roughly oval-shaped closed curve.\n*   The text label **\"man\"** is located outside of this closed curve, positioned to the left.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A thick, horizontal dash or line connects the label **\"man\"** to the label **\"wounded\"**.\n*   There are no branching lines or unconnected lines; it is a single linear connection between the two words.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   Yes, the connecting line crosses the left boundary of the closed curve. It starts outside near \"man\" and terminates inside the curve next to \"wounded\".\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There are no nested closed curves. There is only one closed curve present in the diagram.",
