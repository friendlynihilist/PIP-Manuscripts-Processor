  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Shapes:**\n*   **5 Triangles:** There is **1** large overall triangle. Inside it, the lines form **4** smaller triangles (three upright triangles at the corners and one inverted triangle in the center). This configuration is often recognized as the \"Triforce\" symbol or the first iteration of a Sierpinski triangle.\n\n**Lines:**\n*   **6 Line Segments:**\n    *   **3** lines form the outer perimeter of the large triangle.\n    *   **3** lines form the inner inverted triangle connecting the sides of the larger shape.\n    *   *Note:* The lines are hand-drawn and sketchy, so they are slightly uneven and textured rather than geometrically perfect.\n\n**Nodes / Vertices:**\n*   **6 Nodes:** There are **3** outer corners (vertices) of the large triangle and **3** intersection points where the inner lines meet the outer lines (roughly at the midpoints of the sides).\n\n**Other Elements:**\n*   **0 Words:** There is no text in the image.\n*   **0 Arcs/Circles:** The drawing consists entirely of straight(ish) lines; there are no curved geometric shapes.",
