  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, there are **two main types of elements** present: **letters** (text labels) and **lines** (geometric segments).\n\nHere is the detailed breakdown:\n\n**1. Letters (6 elements)**\nThere are 6 handwritten uppercase letters serving as labels for points on the diagram:\n*   **V** (at the top vertex)\n*   **F** (on the left side)\n*   **G** (on the right side)\n*   **A** (bottom left corner)\n*   **B** (bottom center)\n*   **C** (bottom right corner)\n\n**2. Lines (6 elements)**\nThere are 6 distinct straight line segments drawn to connect these points:\n*   **3 Outer Lines:** Forming the large main triangle (Line AV, Line VC, and the base Line AC).\n*   **3 Internal Lines:**\n    *   A vertical line connecting **V to B**.\n    *   A diagonal line connecting **F to B**.\n    *   A diagonal line connecting **G to B**.\n\n**3. Shapes**\nTogether, these lines form **triangles**. There is one large outer triangle that is subdivided into 4 smaller internal triangles.",
