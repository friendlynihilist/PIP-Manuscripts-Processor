  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there appear to be **2 distinct hand-drawn elements**:\n\n1.  **A short line segment**: Located on the left side, this is a faint, wavy horizontal stroke.\n2.  **An irregular loop or shape**: Located on the right, this is a roughly circular or oval shape drawn with a sketchy, uneven line.\n\nTogether, these elements resemble a quick sketch of a lasso, a balloon on a string, or perhaps a biological diagram, but geometrically they consist of a **line** and a **closed curve (shape)**.",
