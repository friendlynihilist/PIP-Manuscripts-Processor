  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Words (4 items)**\nThere are four handwritten words arranged in two groups:\n*   **\"gives\"** (top left)\n*   **\"to\"** (top center, slightly lower than \"gives\")\n*   **\"steals\"** (bottom left)\n*   **\"from\"** (bottom center, next to \"steals\")\n\n**2. Lines and Arcs (3 main graphical components)**\nThere are several abstract, gestural ink marks surrounding the text:\n*   **Horizontal Swoosh:** A long, curved line that starts to the left of \"gives,\" underlines it, and extends across the middle.\n*   **Vertical Loops/Arcs:** On the right side, there is a complex shape made of several connected loops or zig-zagging arcs, resembling a messy spring or a series of brackets.\n*   **Cross/Arrow Mark:** At the bottom right of the looped shape, there is a crossing stroke that looks like an arrow tip or an \"X\".\n\n**3. Background Elements**\n*   **Grid:** The entire image is set against a background of light blue grid lines, indicating graph paper.",
