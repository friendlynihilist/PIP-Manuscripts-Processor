  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **4 distinct elements** visible:\n\n1.  **One large handwritten character:** A prominent, dark cursive letter (resembling a 'P', 'S', or possibly a 'f') that spans vertically across the image. It features a large upper curve and a smaller loop at the bottom.\n2.  **One partial handwritten character:** A small, dark loop or curve located at the bottom right, which appears to be the start of another letter (like an 'a' or 'o').\n3.  **Two horizontal lines:** There are two faint, dotted or dashed guidelines running horizontally across the background—one through the middle and one near the bottom—typical of handwriting practice paper.",
