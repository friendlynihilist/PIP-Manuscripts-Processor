  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Arcs (Curved Lines): 3**\n*   **1 Large Primary Arc:** A large semi-circle that forms the top of the structure.\n*   **2 Smaller Secondary Arcs:** Attached to the left and right ends of the primary arc, curving downwards.\n\n**2. Straight Lines: 1 (Main)**\n*   **1 Vertical Line:** A central line dropping down from the apex (top center) of the large arc.\n\n**3. Nodes (Dots): 5**\n*   There are **5 dark, filled-in circles or \"dots\"** located at the bottom terminals of the structure.\n    *   One at the bottom of the central vertical line.\n    *   Two at the ends of the left secondary arc.\n    *   Two at the ends of the right secondary arc.\n\n**4. Small Marks/Cross-strokes: ~3**\n*   There are small, short strokes intersecting the main lines, resembling cross-marks or small branches.\n    *   One crosses the central vertical line near the top.\n    *   One intersects the left secondary arc.\n    *   One intersects the right secondary arc.\n\n**5. Background Elements**\n*   **Grid Lines:** The drawing is on graph paper, so there is a grid of faint horizontal and vertical lines in the background.\n\n**Summary:** The image depicts a single hand-drawn symbol or diagram composed of **3 arcs, 1 main vertical line, 5 terminal dots, and 3 small cross-marks**.",
