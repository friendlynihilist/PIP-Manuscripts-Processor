  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Total Elements:**\n*   **2 Main Geometric Shapes** (composed of multiple lines)\n*   **12 Numbers** (digits)\n\n**Detailed Breakdown by Type:**\n\n**1. Geometric Shapes (2 items):**\n*   **Top Diagram:** A hand-drawn figure that resembles two intersecting triangles or a distorted hexagram (six-pointed star). It is composed of roughly 6 connected line segments.\n*   **Bottom Diagram:** A larger, more complex figure consisting of a large, elongated triangle with a smaller quadrilateral (diamond shape) drawn inside it.\n\n**2. Numbers / Digits (12 items):**\nBoth diagrams are labeled with the numbers 1 through 6.\n*   **Top Diagram Labels:**\n    *   **1:** Bottom right corner\n    *   **2:** Bottom left corner\n    *   **3:** Top peak\n    *   **4:** Inner right intersection\n    *   **5:** Inner left intersection\n    *   **6:** Top right peak\n*   **Bottom Diagram Labels:**\n    *   **1:** Labeling the bottom-right side of the inner diamond.\n    *   **2:** Labeling the bottom-left side of the inner diamond.\n    *   **3:** Labeling the top-left side of the inner diamond.\n    *   **4:** Located near the bottom vertex of the large triangle.\n    *   **5:** Labeling the long left outer edge.\n    *   **6:** Labeling the top-right side of the inner diamond.\n\n**3. Lines:**\n*   The shapes are constructed from **hand-drawn straight lines**.\n    *   The top shape is made of approximately 6 intersecting line segments.\n    *   The bottom shape is made of 3 lines forming the outer triangle and 4 lines forming the inner quadrilateral.\n\n**4. Other:**\n*   There are faint, erased pencil markings in the background, particularly on the right side of the page, but they are not distinct shapes.",
