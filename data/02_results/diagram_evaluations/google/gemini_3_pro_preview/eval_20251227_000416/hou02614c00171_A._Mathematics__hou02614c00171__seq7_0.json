  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Numbers (8 items)**\nThere are eight digits labeling the vertices (corners) of the geometric figure:\n*   **1, 2, 7, 8** are in the upper section.\n*   **3, 4, 5, 6** are in the lower section.\n\n**2. Letters (2 items)**\nThere are two lowercase letters labeling specific parts of the diagram (likely edges or crossing points):\n*   **\"a\"** is located near the top crossing lines.\n*   **\"b\"** is located near the bottom crossing lines.\n\n**3. Lines (14 items total)**\nThe diagram is constructed of straight line segments connecting the numbered nodes. They are distinguished by style:\n*   **Solid Lines (8 items):**\n    *   Two outer vertical lines (connecting 2-3 and 7-6).\n    *   Two horizontal lines forming the bases of the inner triangles (connecting 8-1 and 5-4).\n    *   Four diagonal lines connecting outer points to inner points (2-1, 7-8, 3-4, and 6-5).\n*   **Dashed/Dotted Lines (6 items):**\n    *   One top horizontal line (connecting 2-7).\n    *   One bottom horizontal line (connecting 3-6).\n    *   Four intersecting lines in the center connecting the inner nodes (verticals 8-5 and 1-4, and diagonals 8-4 and 5-1).\n\n**4. Shapes**\n*   The overall figure resembles a projection of a 3D object, possibly a cube or a prism, drawn in a specific graph layout.\n*   Visually, the solid lines form two opposing triangular shapes pointing inwards, connected by vertical sides.\n\n**Summary Count:**\n*   **8** Numbers\n*   **2** Letters\n*   **14** Line segments (8 solid, 6 dashed)",
