  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **8 distinct elements** that can be categorized as follows:\n\n1.  **Words (6 elements)**: There are two lines of handwritten text, each containing three words.\n    *   **Top line**: \"is\", \"a\", \"man\"\n    *   **Bottom line**: \"is\", \"a\", \"man\"\n\n2.  **Shapes/Symbols (1 complex element)**:\n    *   To the left of the text, there is a large, handwritten **symbol** that acts as a bracket grouping the two lines. It consists of a thick, dark **C-shaped curve** with a thinner **horizontal oval loop** intersecting its center.\n\n3.  **Lines (1 element)**:\n    *   There is a faint, horizontal blue **line** (part of the lined paper) running through the background, separating the two lines of text.",
