  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the sketch, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Lines (Straight)**\n*   **Quantity:** Approximately **7 to 9** distinct straight lines.\n*   **Description:** These are primarily located in the upper cluster of the drawing.\n    *   There is a group of **3 lines** radiating from a single point on the far left, extending outward to the right like perspective rays.\n    *   There are **2 to 3 long diagonal lines** that intersect these rays, forming a rough \"X\" or cross-like structure in the upper right quadrant.\n    *   There are a few shorter, scratchy straight marks near the intersections.\n\n**2. Lines (Curved / Arcs)**\n*   **Quantity:** Approximately **4 to 5** distinct curved strokes.\n*   **Description:**\n    *   The lower figure is composed almost entirely of a single continuous or connected set of curves, forming a shape that resembles a knot or a stylized insect.\n    *   There are curved strokes at the top of the upper figure, looking somewhat like rabbit ears or loops.\n\n**3. Shapes (Loops / Ovals)**\n*   **Quantity:** **2 to 3** distinct closed or semi-closed shapes.\n*   **Description:**\n    *   **One clear oval** is trapped between the intersecting straight lines in the center of the upper drawing.\n    *   The lower drawing contains a central **loop** shape (resembling a petal) and a bottom loop.\n\n**4. Nodes / Intersections**\n*   **Quantity:** Multiple (at least **5 prominent ones**).\n*   **Description:**\n    *   There is a distinct **convergence node** on the far left where the three \"ray\" lines meet.\n    *   There is a complex **cluster of nodes** in the upper right where the radiating lines cross the vertical/diagonal structure.\n    *   The lower figure has a central intersection point where its curved lines cross over each other.\n\n**5. Words / Text**\n*   **Quantity:** **0**\n*   **Description:** There are no alphanumeric characters, words, or text present in the image. It is purely abstract and gestural.",
