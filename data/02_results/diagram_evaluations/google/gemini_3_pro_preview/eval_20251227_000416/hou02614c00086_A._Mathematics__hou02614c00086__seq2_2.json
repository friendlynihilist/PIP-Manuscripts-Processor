  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Total Count:** 8 elements (specifically, line segments).\n\n**Type of Elements:** Hand-drawn straight lines.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\nThe image is a sketch of a geometric \"house\" shape composed of **8 distinct lines**:\n1.  **Two lines** forming the triangular \"roof\" at the top.\n2.  **Two vertical lines** forming the sides of the box below.\n3.  **One horizontal line** at the bottom forming the base.\n4.  **One horizontal line** in the middle, separating the triangular top from the rectangular bottom.\n5.  **Two diagonal lines** crossing each other inside the rectangular section (forming an \"X\").\n\n**Shapes Formed:**\nTogether, these lines create a composite shape that includes:\n*   A **triangle** on top.\n*   A **rectangle** (or square) on the bottom.\n*   Four smaller triangles created by the intersecting diagonals within the rectangle.\n*   An overall **pentagon** outline.",
