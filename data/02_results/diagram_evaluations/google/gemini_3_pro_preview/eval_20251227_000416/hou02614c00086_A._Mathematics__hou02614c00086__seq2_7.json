  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Shapes**\n*   **1 Main Geometric Figure:** An irregular pentagon (a 5-sided polygon).\n*   **2 Sub-shapes:** The main figure is divided by a diagonal line, creating two distinct internal shapes:\n    *   **A Triangle:** Located at the top.\n    *   **A Quadrilateral:** Located at the bottom.\n\n**2. Lines (Segments)**\nThere are **6 distinct line segments** that make up the drawing:\n*   **2 Blue Lines:** The top edge of the shape and the internal diagonal line are traced in blue ink or colored pencil.\n*   **1 Red Line:** The bottom edge of the shape is traced in red.\n*   **3 Graphite/Black Lines:** The remaining three vertical or slanted sides are drawn in standard pencil or dark ink.\n\n**3. Text and Numbers**\n*   **\"Fig 4\":** Written clearly inside the bottom half of the shape.\n*   **\"1\":** A number written outside the shape to the top left.\n*   **\"Fig\":** A partial word written outside the shape to the top right (likely labeling another figure off-page).\n*   **Illegible Text:** There are faint scribbles or cut-off text at the very bottom edge of the image.\n\n**4. Nodes (Vertices)**\n*   **5 Nodes:** There are 5 distinct corners (vertices) where the line segments intersect to form the outer perimeter of the pentagon.",
