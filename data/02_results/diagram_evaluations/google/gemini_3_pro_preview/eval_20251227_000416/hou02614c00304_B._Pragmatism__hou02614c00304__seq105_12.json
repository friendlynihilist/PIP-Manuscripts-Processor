The text is oriented upside down.\n    *   If you rotate the image 180 degrees, the word that appears on top reads \"**Complex**\".\n    *   The word below it reads \"**zeros**\".\n2.  **1 Arc**: There is a prominent curved line (or bracket) on the right side. This arc connects or groups the two lines of text together.\n\nThese elements are written in dark ink on a piece of **graph paper**, indicated by the faint grid lines in the background.",
