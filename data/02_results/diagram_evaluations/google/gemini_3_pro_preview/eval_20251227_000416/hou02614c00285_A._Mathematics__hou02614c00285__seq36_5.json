  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n*   **1 Large Square Shape:** The main outline of the drawing is a roughly drawn square or rectangle.\n*   **4 Smaller Rectangular Sections (Quadrants):** The large square is divided by intersecting lines into four smaller areas.\n*   **6 Structural Lines:** There are four lines forming the outer border and two internal lines (one vertical, one horizontal) that intersect to create the grid.\n*   **2 Sets of Scribbled Lines:** There are diagonal zigzag or hatched lines used for shading in two of the quadrants (the top-right and the bottom-left). The other two quadrants are empty.",
