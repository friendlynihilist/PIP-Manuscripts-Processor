  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n*   **Shapes (3 total):**\n    *   **1** large, irregular oval shape that acts as the outer boundary of the sketch.\n    *   **2** smaller, elliptical shapes positioned vertically inside the larger oval.\n\n*   **Words (2 total):**\n    *   There are **2** handwritten words, one inside each of the smaller inner ovals. The text appears to be upside down. If rotated 180 degrees, the words read \"**Lympho**\" (in the bottom oval) and \"**-cytes**\" (in the top oval), labeling the drawing as a lymphocyte.\n\n*   **Lines (Numerous):**\n    *   There are many short, sketchy **hatching lines** filling the space between the inner ovals and the outer boundary, creating a shaded or textured effect.\n    *   There is a faint **grid pattern** in the background, indicating the drawing is on graph paper.",
