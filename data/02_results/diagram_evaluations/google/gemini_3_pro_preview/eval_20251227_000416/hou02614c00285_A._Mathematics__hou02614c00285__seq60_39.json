  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **2 shapes** present.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the elements:\n*   **1 complete shape:** Located in the center, it is a hand-drawn, irregular closed loop (roughly oval or hexagonal in appearance) created with sketchy pencil lines.\n*   **1 partial shape:** Visible at the very bottom edge of the image, appearing as the top curve of a similar sketched object.",
