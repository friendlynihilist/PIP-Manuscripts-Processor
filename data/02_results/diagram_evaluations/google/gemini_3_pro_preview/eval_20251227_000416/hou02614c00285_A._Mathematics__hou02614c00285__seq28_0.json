  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Total Elements: Approximately 8 distinct high-level elements.**\n\nHere is the detailed classification:\n\n**1. Shapes (2 items)**\n*   **Two Square Grids:** There are two hand-drawn squares, one positioned above the other. Both are divided into four quadrants (2x2) by a vertical line and a horizontal line intersecting in the middle. These resemble Punnett squares or probability matrices.\n\n**2. Text / Variables (4 items)**\n*   These are mathematical labels written around the **bottom** square grid:\n    *   **\"p\"**: Located above the left column.\n    *   **\"1-p\"**: Located above the right column.\n    *   **\"q\"**: Located to the left of the top row.\n    *   **\"1-q\"**: Located to the left of the bottom row.\n\n**3. Arcs / Curves (2 items)**\n*   **Two Curved Lines:** Located to the immediate left of the **top** square grid. These look like faint parentheses or brackets, likely intended to group the rows, though no text is written next to them.\n\n**Summary of Composition:**\nThe image consists of **lines** forming the two main grid **shapes**, accompanied by **text** variables on the bottom grid and **arcs** on the top grid. The content suggests a diagram used in probability theory or genetics (specifically relating to allele frequencies).",
