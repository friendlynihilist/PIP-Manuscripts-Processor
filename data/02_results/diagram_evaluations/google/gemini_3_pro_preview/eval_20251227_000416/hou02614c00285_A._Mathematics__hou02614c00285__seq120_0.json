  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Letters (6 items)**\nThere are 6 handwritten capital letters acting as labels for various parts of the geometric figure:\n*   **V** (at the top vertex)\n*   **A** (at the bottom left vertex)\n*   **B** (at the bottom middle point)\n*   **C** (at the bottom right vertex)\n*   **F** (labeling the left internal section)\n*   **G** (labeling the right internal section)\n\n**2. Lines / Line Segments (6 items)**\nThere are 6 distinct hand-drawn line segments that make up the diagram:\n*   **3 Outer Lines:** Forming the main large triangle (Side AV, Side VC, and Base AC).\n*   **3 Internal Lines:**\n    *   One vertical line connecting **V** to **B**.\n    *   One diagonal line connecting point **B** to the left side (near label F).\n    *   One diagonal line connecting point **B** to the right side (near label G).\n\n**3. Nodes / Vertices (6 items)**\nThere are 6 points where lines intersect or end:\n*   Point **A**\n*   Point **B**\n*   Point **C**\n*   Point **V**\n*   The intersection point on the left side (between A and V).\n*   The intersection point on the right side (between V and C).\n\n**4. Shapes**\n*   **Triangles:** The primary shape is a large triangle. The internal lines subdivide this main shape into several smaller triangles (at least 4 distinct smaller triangles are visible within the larger one).",
