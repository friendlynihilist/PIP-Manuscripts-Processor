  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Text / Labels (4 items)**\n*   **\"qm\"**: Written to the right of the top section of the diagram.\n*   **\"pm\"**: Written inside the large curved section at the bottom.\n*   **\"m\"**: Written below the large bottom curve.\n*   **\"1-9\"**: Partially visible in the bottom right corner (along with what looks like the start of another label).\n\n**2. Shapes (1 main composite shape)**\n*   **Rectangular Grid**: The central element is a roughly drawn rectangle divided into four sections (a 2x2 grid).\n    *   The top row is significantly shorter than the bottom row.\n    *   The **top-left section** is filled with diagonal **hatching** (shading lines).\n\n**3. Lines (Approx. 12 distinct strokes)**\n*   **Structural Lines**: There are roughly 6 main straight lines forming the borders and internal dividers of the rectangular grid (3 vertical, 3 horizontal).\n*   **Shading Lines**: There are about 6 diagonal lines used to shade the top-left box.\n\n**4. Arcs / Curves (4 items)**\n*   **Top Right Loop**: A small semi-circle or \"handle\" shape attached to the top right corner of the rectangle.\n*   **Internal Curve**: A shallow curve underneath the bottom-left quadrant of the rectangle.\n*   **Bottom U-Curve**: A large, deep U-shaped curve that encompasses the bottom of the diagram, containing the \"pm\" label.\n*   **Bottom Right Arcs**: Two connected humps (resembling the top of a letter 'm' or a bridge) are partially visible in the bottom right corner.",
