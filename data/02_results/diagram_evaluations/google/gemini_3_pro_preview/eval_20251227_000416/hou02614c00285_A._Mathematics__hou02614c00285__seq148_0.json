  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, there are **8 distinct elements** that can be categorized as follows:\n\n**Shapes (1):**\n*   **1 Circle:** A hand-drawn circle centered on the intersecting lines.\n\n**Lines (4):**\n*   **1 Horizontal Line:** Acting as the x-axis, crossing through the center of the circle.\n*   **1 Vertical Line:** Acting as the y-axis, crossing through the center of the circle.\n*   **1 Diagonal Line:** A radial line extending from the center into the first quadrant (top right).\n*   **1 Vertical Segment:** A faint line dropping from the diagonal line down to the horizontal axis, forming a right triangle.\n\n**Arcs (1):**\n*   **1 Curved Arc:** A line indicating an angle, drawn between the vertical axis and the diagonal line.\n\n**Symbols (1):**\n*   **1 Greek Letter:** The symbol Theta (**$\\theta$**) is written above the arc to label the angle.\n\n**Nodes (1):**\n*   **1 Center Point:** The central intersection point where the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines meet.",
