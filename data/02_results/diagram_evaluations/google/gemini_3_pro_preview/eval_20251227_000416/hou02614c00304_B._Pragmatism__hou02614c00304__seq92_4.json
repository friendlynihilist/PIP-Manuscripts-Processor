  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Nodes (Dots)**\n*   **Count:** 7\n*   **Description:** There are 7 distinct, filled-in black circles (dots) arranged in a horizontal row along the bottom of the diagram.\n\n**2. Arcs (Curved Lines)**\n*   **Count:** 6\n*   **Description:** There are 6 arch-shaped curved lines that connect the nodes together. These loops create a coil or spring-like appearance, bridging the gap between each adjacent pair of dots.\n\n**3. Text / Labels**\n*   **Count:** 4 groups\n*   **Description:** There are handwritten labels located below the diagram (oriented upside-down relative to the viewing angle). They appear to be alphanumeric labels, likely reading **\"$A_0, A_1, A_2, A_3$\"** (or similar variables) corresponding to the segments or nodes.\n\n**4. Background Elements**\n*   **Description:** The drawing is on graph paper, characterized by a grid of faint blue horizontal and vertical lines.",
