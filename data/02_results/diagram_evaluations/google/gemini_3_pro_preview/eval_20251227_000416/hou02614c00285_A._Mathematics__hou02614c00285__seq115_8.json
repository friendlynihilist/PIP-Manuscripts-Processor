  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are two main kinds of elements present: **geometric lines** and **handwritten numbers**.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Lines (4 elements):**\n    *   There are **4** distinct hand-drawn line segments that make up the geometric figure.\n        *   One diagonal line forming the left side.\n        *   One diagonal line forming the right side.\n        *   One horizontal line forming the base.\n        *   One vertical-ish line dropping from the top vertex to the base, dividing the large triangle into two smaller ones.\n\n2.  **Shapes (3 elements):**\n    *   The arrangement of the lines creates **3** triangular shapes:\n        *   The large overall triangle.\n        *   The left sub-triangle.\n        *   The right sub-triangle.\n\n3.  **Numbers (3 elements):**\n    *   There are **3** handwritten characters that appear to be numbers labeling the sides of the right-hand triangle (suggesting a 3-4-5 right triangle problem):\n        *   A **\"4\"** located inside the triangle, next to the vertical dividing line (representing the height).\n        *   A **\"5\"** (or possibly a symbol) located near the right diagonal side (representing the hypotenuse).\n        *   A **\"3\"** located below the base of the right sub-triangle.",
