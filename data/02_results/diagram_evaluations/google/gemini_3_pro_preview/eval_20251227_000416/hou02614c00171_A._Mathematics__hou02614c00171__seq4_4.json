  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Quantity:**\n*   There is **1** primary element in the image.\n\n**Kind of Elements:**\n*   **Type:** It is a **hand-drawn sketch** or **scribble**.\n*   **Components:** The drawing is composed of a single, continuous dark **line** that curves and loops.\n*   **Shape:** The line forms an **abstract shape** that loosely resembles a distorted heart, a knot, or a fragment of a cursive signature.\n*   **Features:**\n    *   **Arcs/Curves:** There are two main sweeping curves that form the upper lobes of the shape.\n    *   **Loops:** There is a distinct, small loop in the center-right area and the overall structure forms a larger, open loop.\n    *   **Intersections:** The line crosses over itself at approximately three points, creating \"X\" shaped intersections.",
