  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **20 distinct elements** consisting of numbers, letters/symbols, and lines. Here is the detailed breakdown:\n\n**1. Numbers (8 elements)**\nThere are 8 digits placed at the vertices (corners) of the geometric shape:\n*   **1, 6, 7, 8** are in the lower half.\n*   **2, 3, 4, 5** are in the upper half.\n\n**2. Letters & Symbols (2 elements)**\nThere are markers at the two central intersection points:\n*   The letter **\"B\"** is clearly written at the lower crossing point.\n*   There is a dark, scribbled **mark or symbol** (likely representing the letter **\"A\"** or a small figure) at the upper crossing point.\n\n**3. Lines (10 elements)**\nThe geometric figure is constructed from various line segments:\n*   **Solid Lines (6):**\n    *   Two vertical lines forming the outer sides (connecting 1-2 and 6-5).\n    *   Four diagonal lines that cross to form two \"X\" shapes (connecting 2-3, 5-4, 1-8, and 6-7).\n*   **Dashed Lines (4):**\n    *   Two horizontal dashed lines connecting the top (2-5) and bottom (1-6).\n    *   Two internal vertical dashed lines connecting the inner points (4-7 and 3-8).",
