  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, there are **7 distinct drawn elements** which can be categorized as follows:\n\n1.  **1 Continuous Curve/Shape:** The primary element is a single, continuous hand-drawn line that loops around to form a three-lobed shape, resembling a trefoil knot or a propeller.\n2.  **6 Short Lines/Ticks:** There are small, dark dashes intersecting the main curve. They are distributed in pairs on each of the three loops (2 on the top-left loop, 2 on the right loop, and 2 on the bottom loop).",
