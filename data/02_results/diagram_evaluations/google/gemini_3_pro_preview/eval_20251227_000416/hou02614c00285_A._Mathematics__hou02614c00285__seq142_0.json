  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Words (2 elements)**\n*   There are **2** handwritten words in cursive at the top left: **\"Try\"** and **\"again\"**.\n\n**2. Shapes (4 elements)**\n*   **Large Circles:** There are **2** large, roughly drawn circles or ovals. One is on the left side and one is on the right side.\n*   **Small Circles:** There are **2** smaller circles drawn inside the large circle on the left.\n\n**3. Lines (Approximately 5 distinct elements)**\n*   **Horizontal Line:** There is **1** horizontal line cutting across the center of the large left circle.\n*   **Diagonal Lines:** There appear to be **2** segments of a diagonal line passing through the center of the large left circle (one segment connects to the lower small circle).\n*   **Radial Line:** There is **1** straight line inside the large right circle, extending from the top-left edge toward the center.\n*   **Connecting Line:** There is a faint, wavy line connecting the top of the left circle to the right circle.\n\n**4. Nodes/Points (3 elements)**\n*   There are **2** distinct center points or dots inside the two smaller circles on the left.\n*   There is **1** small loop or node at the end of the line inside the large right circle.",
