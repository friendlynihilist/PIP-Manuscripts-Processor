  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are approximately **9 distinct mathematical elements** forming a handwritten expression.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the kinds of elements present:\n\n**1. Mathematical Symbols (3 elements):**\n*   **Plus sign (+):** Located on the far left.\n*   **Square root / Radical symbol ($\\sqrt{}$):** A large symbol covering the second half of the expression.\n*   **Minus sign (-):** Located inside the square root.\n\n**2. Letters / Variables (3 elements):**\n*   **Letter \"C\":** Following the plus sign.\n*   **Letter \"A\":** Inside the square root.\n*   **Letter \"B\" (or possibly \"p\" or \"x\"):** The second variable inside the square root. It is somewhat ambiguous due to the handwriting but serves as a variable.\n\n**3. Numbers (3 elements):**\n*   **Number \"2\":** Appears three separate times, functioning as an exponent (superscript) for each of the three letters ($C^2$, $A^2$, and the third variable squared).\n\nAdditionally, there are some **faint, illegible pencil marks** or partial words in the top right corner that are cut off and not part of the main formula.\n\n**Summary:** The image contains a mathematical formula that appears to be:  \n**$+ C^2 \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}$** (or similar variables).",
