  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n*   **1 Shape:** There is one outer, roughly circular or oval shape that encloses the drawing.\n*   **3 Lines:** Inside the circle, there are three straight-ish line segments radiating from the center to the outer edge, dividing the circle into three sections.\n*   **1 Node:** There is a central intersection point (or node) where the three internal lines meet.\n\nIn total, the sketch is composed of **5 distinct geometric elements** (1 circle + 3 lines + 1 central point).",
