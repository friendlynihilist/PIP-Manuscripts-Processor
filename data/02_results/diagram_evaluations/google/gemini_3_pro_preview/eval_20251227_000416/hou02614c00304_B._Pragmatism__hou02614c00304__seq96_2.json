Shapes / Lines (1 main complex element)**\n*   **1 Large Stylized Curve:** There is a single, large, sweeping ink stroke that forms a shape resembling a capital letter \"**G**\" or a stylized ear. This curvilinear shape acts as a container, wrapping around the top and bottom of the text phrases. It consists of several connected arcs and loops.\n\n**3. Background (1 pattern)**\n*   **1 Grid Pattern:** The entire sketch is drawn on a sheet of graph paper, characterized by a grid of intersecting light blue vertical and horizontal lines.",
