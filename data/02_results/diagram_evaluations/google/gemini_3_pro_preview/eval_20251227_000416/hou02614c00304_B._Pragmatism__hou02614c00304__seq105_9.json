  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Shapes (3 total)**\n*   **1 Large Outer Oval:** A rough, hand-drawn oval that encompasses the entire diagram.\n*   **2 Inner Ovals:** Two smaller, roughly kidney-shaped ovals located inside the larger one.\n\n**2. Words (2 total)**\n*   **\"cortex\":** Handwritten inside the top inner oval (note: the text is upside down relative to the image orientation).\n*   **\"medulla\":** Handwritten inside the bottom inner oval (also upside down).\n\n**3. Lines (Multiple)**\n*   **Hatching Lines:** There are numerous horizontal, sketchy lines filling the space between the outer oval and the inner ovals, likely representing texture or a solid mass.\n*   **1 Connecting Arc:** There is a thick, dark curved line (an arc) on the right side that connects the two inner text labels/ovals.",
