It is filled with horizontal hatching lines.\n*   **Inner Oval:** A smaller, clear oval shape enclosing the word \"zoologist.\"\n\n**3. Lines and Connectors**\nThere are **3** primary connecting lines:\n*   **Top Bracket:** A curved line connecting \"millionaire\" to the word \"gives.\"\n*   **Middle Bracket:** A curved line connecting the \"zoologist\" oval to the first \"lady.\"\n*   **Long Curved Line:** A line connecting \"gives\" down to the second, bolded \"lady.\"\n\n**4. Other Graphical Elements**\n*   **Hatching:** Numerous horizontal lines filling the background of the large outer shape.\n*   **Dash:** A thick horizontal dash separating \"gives\" and \"cat.\"\n*   **Grid:** The entire drawing is on graph paper with a light blue grid background.",
