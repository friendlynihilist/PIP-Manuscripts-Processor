  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Main Object:**\n*   There is **one** main hand-drawn sketch depicting an irregular, faceted geometric form. It resembles a rock, a crystal, or a rough 3D solid.\n\n**2. Component Elements:**\n*   **Lines:** The drawing is constructed from approximately **14 to 15 distinct line segments**.\n    *   These are dark, hand-drawn strokes.\n    *   They vary in thickness; for example, the vertical line in the lower-left interior is notably bolder/thicker than the others.\n    *   There is one horizontal line segment on the left side that extends slightly outside the boundary of the main shape.\n*   **Shapes/Faces:** The lines create a closed loop that is subdivided internally. There are **6 distinct enclosed regions** or \"faces\" within the main shape. These regions vary from triangular to quadrilateral and irregular polygonal shapes.\n*   **Nodes/Vertices:** There are approximately **9 to 10 nodes** (points where lines intersect or meet). These include \"Y\" junctions inside the shape and corners along the outer perimeter.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe image consists of **one complex shape** composed of **lines**, **nodes**, and **enclosed polygonal regions**, with no text or perfect geometric primitives (like circles) present.",
