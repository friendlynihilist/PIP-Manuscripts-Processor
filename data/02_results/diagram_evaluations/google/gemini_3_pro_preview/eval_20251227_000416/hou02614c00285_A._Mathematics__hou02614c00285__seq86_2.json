  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **three main hand-drawn elements** visible:\n\n1.  **One Circle**: A roughly drawn circular or oval shape located on the left side.\n2.  **Two Arcs**: A pair of connected, upward-curving lines (resembling hills or the letter \"m\") extending to the right of the circle.\n3.  **One Horizontal Line**: A rough, straight line segment that runs beneath the arcs, connecting their bases.\n\nThere are no words, distinct nodes, or complex shapes present; the image consists entirely of a simple pencil sketch composed of these basic geometric lines and curves.",
