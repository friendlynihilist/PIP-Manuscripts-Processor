  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **2** distinct hand-drawn elements present:\n\n1.  **One main continuous curved line**: This is the primary element of the drawing. It is a thick, dark, graphite-like line that loops over itself twice to form an abstract, organic shape. The shape is irregular but somewhat resembles a rough sketch of an apple or a distorted knot.\n2.  **One small, faint curved line**: Located at the very top of the main shape, there is a thin, short arc that looks like a stray mark or a sketch of a stem.\n\nThere are no words, geometric shapes (like perfect circles or squares), or other distinct objects in the image. The background is a textured, off-white paper.",
