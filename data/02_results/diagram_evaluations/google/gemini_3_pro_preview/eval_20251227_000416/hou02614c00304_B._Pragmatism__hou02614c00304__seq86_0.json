  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **13 distinct hand-drawn elements** comprising the diagram. They can be categorized as follows:\n\n**1. Nodes / Letters (5 elements)**\nThere are 5 vertices labeled with lowercase letters or circular shapes:\n*   **a:** Located at the middle-left.\n*   **b:** Located at the middle-right.\n*   **c:** Located at the bottom-left.\n*   **d:** Located at the bottom-right.\n*   **e (or o):** A small circle/letter located at the very top right.\n\n**2. Straight Lines (6 elements)**\nThere are 6 straight line segments connecting these nodes:\n*   A horizontal line connecting **a** to **b**.\n*   A vertical line connecting **a** to **c**.\n*   A vertical line connecting **b** to **d**.\n*   A horizontal line connecting **c** to **d**.\n*   A diagonal line connecting **b** to the top node (**e**).\n*   A short diagonal line extending downwards and to the left from node **c**.\n\n**3. Arcs / Curved Lines (2 elements)**\nThere are 2 curved lines connecting the outer nodes:\n*   A long arc connecting **a** to the top node (**e**).\n*   A long arc connecting **d** to the top node (**e**).\n\nTogether, these elements form a graph theory diagram sketched on graph paper.",
