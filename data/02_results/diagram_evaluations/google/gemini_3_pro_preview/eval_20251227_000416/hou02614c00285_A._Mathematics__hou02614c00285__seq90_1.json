  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, the elements can be identified as follows:\n\n*   **1 Shape:** There is **1** roughly circular shape that forms the outer boundary of the sketch. It appears hand-drawn with multiple overlapping strokes.\n*   **3 Lines:** Inside the circle, there are **3** distinct straight line segments:\n    *   One horizontal line running across the middle (resembling a diameter or chord).\n    *   Two diagonal lines that meet at a vertex on the right side, forming an acute angle (a \"V\" shape).",
