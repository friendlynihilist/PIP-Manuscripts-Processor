  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Lines (6 total)**\nThe main structure is a hand-drawn grid composed of:\n*   **4 perimeter lines:** These form the outer square/rectangle shape.\n*   **2 internal dividing lines:** One vertical line and one horizontal line that intersect to divide the box.\n\n**2. Shapes (5 geometric regions)**\n*   **1 large rectangle:** The overall outer boundary.\n*   **4 smaller rectangles:** The internal cells created by the intersecting dividing lines. (Note: The cells are unequal in size; the top-left is the largest, and the bottom-right is the smallest).\n\n**3. Symbols / Text (2 elements)**\nTo the left of the grid, there are two handwritten annotations:\n*   **Top symbol:** Appears to be the letter **\"n\"**.\n*   **Bottom symbol:** Appears to be the letter **\"n\" with a horizontal bar over it** (often used in math to denote a mean, $\\overline{n}$, or a specific variable).\n\n**Summary Count:**\n*   **Lines:** 6\n*   **Shapes:** 5 (1 main container + 4 sub-shapes)\n*   **Symbols:** 2",
