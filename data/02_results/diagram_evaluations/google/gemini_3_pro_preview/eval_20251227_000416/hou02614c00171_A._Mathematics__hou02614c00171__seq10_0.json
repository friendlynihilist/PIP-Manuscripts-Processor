  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, there are **20** distinct elements comprising the drawing. Here is the breakdown by type:\n\n1.  **1 Oval**: There is a single large, hand-drawn oval shape that encircles the entire inner structure.\n2.  **8 Nodes**: There are 8 distinct points or vertices where lines intersect, often marked by darker ink spots.\n    *   One central hub node.\n    *   Seven nodes forming the corners of the surrounding polygon shape (top-left, top-right, right-side, bottom-right, bottom-center, bottom-left, and far-left).\n3.  **11 Lines**: There are 11 line segments connecting these nodes.\n    *   **7 Perimeter Lines**: These form the outer boundary of the inner shape, connecting the outer nodes in a loop.\n    *   **4 Internal Lines**: These radiate from the central hub node, connecting it to the top-left, top-right, far-left, and bottom-center nodes.",
