  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, the following elements are present:\n\n**Shapes (Loops):**\n*   **3 connected loops** forming a central clover-like cluster.\n    *   One loop on the top left.\n    *   One loop on the top right.\n    *   One loop at the bottom.\n\n**Lines (Extensions):**\n*   **3 extending lines** radiating outward from the main cluster:\n    *   One line extending diagonally up and to the left from the left loop.\n    *   One line extending diagonally up and to the right from the right loop.\n    *   One short line extending vertically down from the bottom loop.\n\n**Nodes (Junctions):**\n*   There are approximately **7 distinct nodes** (thickened dots or intersection points) visible on the main structure where lines meet or change direction:\n    *   1 central node where the three loops converge.\n    *   3 nodes on the outer perimeter where the extending lines attach.\n    *   3 intermediate nodes where the individual loops touch each other.\n\n**Disconnected Element:**\n*   **1 V-shaped figure** located in the bottom left corner, separate from the main drawing. It consists of two short lines meeting at a point.",
