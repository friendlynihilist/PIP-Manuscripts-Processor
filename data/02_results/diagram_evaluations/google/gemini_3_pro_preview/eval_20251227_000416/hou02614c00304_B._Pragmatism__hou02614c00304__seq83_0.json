Line/Connector Elements (5 Main Lines)**\nThere are 5 distinct drawn lines used to connect the text elements:\n*   **2 Branching Brackets (Braces):**\n    *   One connecting \"act of transfer\" to the top group of three terms.\n    *   One connecting \"act of theft\" to the bottom group of three terms.\n*   **3 Curved Arcs:**\n    *   An outer arc connecting the top \"performed by\" to the bottom \"performed by\".\n    *   A middle arc connecting \"enriching\" to \"empoverishing\".\n    *   An inner arc connecting \"operated upon\" to \"removing\".\n\n**3.
