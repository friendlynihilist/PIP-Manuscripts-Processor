  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, there are **9 distinct elements** composed of shapes and lines:\n\n1.  **Shapes (2 elements):**\n    *   **1 large irregular circle/oval:** This forms the outer boundary of the sketch.\n    *   **1 small irregular circle/oval:** This is located near the center, resembling a nucleus or hub.\n\n2.  **Lines (7 elements):**\n    *   **6 radiating lines:** There are approximately six short, straight lines radiating outwards from the central small circle towards the bottom and left sides of the outer circle.\n    *   **1 short dash:** There is a faint, short horizontal line located just above the top of the large outer circle.",
