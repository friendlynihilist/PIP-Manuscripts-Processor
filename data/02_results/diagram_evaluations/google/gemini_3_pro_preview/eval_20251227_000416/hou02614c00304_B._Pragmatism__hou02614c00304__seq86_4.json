  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Main Figure (Hand-drawn Sketch):**\n*   **Lines/Strokes:** There are approximately **5 to 6 distinct linear segments** connected to form a branching structure.\n    *   One vertical stroke pointing up at the top.\n    *   One diagonal stroke pointing down and to the left.\n    *   One central diagonal stroke connecting the top and bottom sections.\n    *   One diagonal stroke pointing up and to the right.\n    *   One vertical stroke pointing down at the bottom.\n    *   There is also a tiny \"thorn\" or spur mark on the central connecting line.\n*   **Loops/Shapes:** There are **2 closed loops** integrated into the structure.\n    *   One small, roughly circular loop at the top intersection.\n    *   One slightly larger, triangular or D-shaped loop at the bottom intersection.\n\n**2. Background Elements:**\n*   **Grid Lines:** The drawing is on graph paper, so there is a background pattern of faint vertical and horizontal lines forming a grid.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe image contains **one main connected figure** composed of roughly **6 linear strokes** and **2 loops**, set against a **grid background**. The overall shape resembles a stylized branch, a twig, or perhaps a chemical structure diagram.",
