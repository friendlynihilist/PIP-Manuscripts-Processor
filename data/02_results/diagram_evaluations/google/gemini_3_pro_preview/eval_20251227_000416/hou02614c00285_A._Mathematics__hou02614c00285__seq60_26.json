  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **2 distinct elements**:\n\n1.  **One Shape**: A rough, hand-drawn, irregular circular or oval outline. It has jagged edges and appears to be sketched with a pencil or charcoal.\n2.  **One Internal Symbol/Marking**: Inside the circular shape, specifically in the upper-right area, there is a faint, blurry marking. It resembles a letter (possibly a \"T\" or \"F\") or a small cross made of two short intersecting lines.",
