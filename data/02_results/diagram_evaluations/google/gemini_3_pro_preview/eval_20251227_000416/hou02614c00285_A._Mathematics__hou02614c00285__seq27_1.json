  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Shapes & Lines:**\n*   **1 Segmented Strip:** The central element is a wavy, ribbon-like rectangular shape. It is divided into **3 sections** by **4 vertical lines**.\n*   **4 Arcs:** There are curved lines interacting with the strip:\n    *   **2 Arcs** arching over the top of the strip.\n    *   **2 U-shaped curves** (or loops) dipping below the strip.\n\n**Text & Symbols:**\n*   **2 Letters:** The lowercase letters **\"p\"** and **\"q\"** are clearly visible beneath the two bottom curves.\n*   **Faint Markings:** There are illegible scribbles or mathematical notations at the very top of the image and faintly inside the bottom curves.\n\n**Total Count Summary:**\n*   **1** Main composite shape (the ribbon)\n*   **4** Distinct curved lines (arcs)\n*   **2** Legible letters\n*   **2-3** Areas of faint/illegible text",
