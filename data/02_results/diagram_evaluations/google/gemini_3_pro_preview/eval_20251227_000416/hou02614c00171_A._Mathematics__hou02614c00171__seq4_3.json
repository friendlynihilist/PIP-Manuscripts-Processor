  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is the breakdown of the elements:\n\n*   **1 Shape:** The primary element is a single, hand-drawn geometric figure known as a **trefoil knot** (or a triquetra).\n*   **1 Line:** The shape is formed by one continuous curved line that loops around itself.\n*   **3 Loops:** The line creates three distinct lobes or petal-like loops.\n*   **3 Nodes (Intersections):** There are three points where the line crosses over itself to form the knot structure.",
