  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Lines**\n*   **1 Main Horizontal Line:** There is a long, dark horizontal line that serves as the base or axis for the entire sketch.\n*   **1 Internal Line Segment:** Inside the larger arc, there is a thinner, somewhat straight line connecting the left side of the arc to the central scribble.\n\n**2. Arcs**\n*   **2 Arcs:** There are two semi-circular shapes.\n    *   **Large Arc:** A big semi-circle on the left side that arches over the main horizontal line.\n    *   **Small Arc:** A smaller, separate semi-circle located to the right of the large one.\n\n**3. Nodes / Dots**\n*   **Approximately 7-8 Dots:** There are several heavy, dark blobs or dots placed along the main horizontal line.\n    *   One is floating slightly below the line on the far left.\n    *   The others are spaced out along the line, marking the start and end points of the arcs and intervals in between.\n\n**4. Irregular Shapes / Scribbles**\n*   **1 Scribble:** Inside the large arc, towards the right side, there is a cluster of messy, intersecting lines that form an undefined shape or scribble.\n\n**5. Background**\n*   **Grid:** The sketch is drawn on graph paper, so there is a background grid of faint blue vertical and horizontal lines.",
