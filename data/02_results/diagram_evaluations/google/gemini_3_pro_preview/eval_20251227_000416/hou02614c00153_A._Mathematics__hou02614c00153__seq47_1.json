  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, there are **4 distinct hand-drawn elements** that make up the sketch, along with background elements from the paper itself.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\n**Drawn Elements (4 total):**\n1.  **Outer Shape:** One large, roughly circular or oval outline enclosing the entire drawing.\n2.  **Inner Shape:** One smaller, roughly circular or oval outline nested inside the outer shape.\n3.  **Central Figure:** One thick, dark, inverted \"Y-shaped\" line or branching structure in the center.\n4.  **Small Loop:** One small oval or ring shape that intersects/encircles the right leg of the central \"Y\" figure.\n\n**Background Elements:**\n*   **Lines:** There are faint horizontal blue lines visible, indicating the drawing is on lined notebook paper. One line passes directly through the center of the sketch.",
