  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Shapes:**\n*   **2 Oval/Elliptical Shapes:** There are two main, roughly oval-shaped regions positioned vertically—one at the top and one at the bottom. These appear to be the primary \"nodes\" or bodies of the sketch.\n\n**Lines and Arcs:**\n*   **1 Solid Arc:** A thick, solid curved line connects the right side of the top oval to the right side of the bottom oval.\n*   **1 Dashed Arc:** A broken or dashed curved line (composed of about 3 distinct dashes) connects the left side of the top oval to the left side of the bottom oval.\n*   **~8-10 Horizontal Hatching Lines:** Inside both the top and bottom ovals, there are several thin, horizontal lines sketched across the width, likely intended as shading or texture.\n\n**Abstract/Symbolic Elements:**\n*   **2 \"Squiggly\" Lines:** Running horizontally through the center of each oval is a darker, more complex line. These look like spirals, loops, or illegible cursive writing, but they do not form recognizable words.\n\n**Background:**\n*   **Grid Lines:** The entire sketch is drawn on graph paper, indicated by the faint vertical and horizontal grid lines in the background.\n\n**Words:**\n*   **0 Words:** There are no legible words or text in the image.",
