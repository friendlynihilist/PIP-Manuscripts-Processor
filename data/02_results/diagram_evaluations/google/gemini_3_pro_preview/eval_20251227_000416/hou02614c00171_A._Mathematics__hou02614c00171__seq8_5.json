  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Geometric Shapes & Figures (2 distinct groups)**\n*   **Top Figure:** A large, complex hand-drawn geometric diagram. It appears to be an irregular polygon (possibly a distorted kite or large triangle) containing several internal intersecting lines that form smaller triangles and quadrilaterals.\n*   **Bottom Figure:** A smaller, simpler sketch in the bottom left corner. It resembles a star shape formed by two intersecting triangles (similar to a loose Star of David).\n\n**2. Lines**\n*   **Solid Lines:** There are numerous straight, hand-drawn graphite lines that make up the boundaries and internal structure of the geometric shapes.\n*   **Dashed Line:** There is a single horizontal dashed line located at the very top of the page, to the right of the letter \"A\".\n\n**3. Alphanumeric Characters**\n*   **Letters:** There is **1** clear letter: a capital **\"A\"** located at the top left.\n*   **Numbers:** There are approximately **10 to 12** numbers scattered around and inside the top figure, seemingly used to label sides or vertices. Visible numbers include:\n    *   **1** (inside lower left)\n    *   **2** (inside upper left)\n    *   **3** (outside upper right)\n    *   **4** (outside lower left)\n    *   **5** (appears twice: once on the top left edge, once near the top vertex)\n    *   **6** (appears twice: once near the center, once at the bottom vertex)\n    *   **8** (appears twice: near the right-side intersections)\n\n**4. Other Elements**\n*   **Nodes/Tick Marks:** There are small cross-hatches or tick marks on several lines, likely indicating specific points, vertices, or measurements (e.g., on the vertical line inside the top shape).\n*   **Scribble:** There is an illegible scribble or loop inside the center of the top figure.",
