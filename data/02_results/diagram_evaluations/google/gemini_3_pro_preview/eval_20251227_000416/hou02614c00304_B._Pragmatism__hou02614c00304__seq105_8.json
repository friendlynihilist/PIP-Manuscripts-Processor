  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n*   **2 Handwritten Words:** There are two distinct lines of text written in dark cursive ink. The text appears to be upside down. If rotated 180 degrees, the words likely read \"Name\" and \"Sample\".\n*   **2 Dashes:** There is a short horizontal dash (hyphen) at the end of each handwritten word.\n*   **1 Small Mark:** There is a small dot or stray ink mark located centrally between the two lines of text.\n*   **Grid Lines:** The background consists of a grid pattern formed by intersecting vertical and horizontal lines, characteristic of graph paper.",
