  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here are the elements present:\n\n1.  **Shapes (2):**\n    *   **One large circle:** This is the main outer boundary, roughly circular and hand-drawn.\n    *   **One small circle:** A tiny, irregular circle or loop located near the center of the large circle.\n\n2.  **Lines (1):**\n    *   There is a single **line segment** (or \"tail\") that extends from the left side. It starts outside the large circle, touches the perimeter, and continues inward to connect to the small central circle.\n\n3.  **Background:**\n    *   **Grid lines:** The drawing is on graph paper, so there is a background pattern of faint vertical and horizontal lines.",
