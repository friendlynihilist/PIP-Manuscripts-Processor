  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **7 distinct elements** which can be categorized as follows:\n\n*   **2 Nodes:** There are two dark, roughly circular blobs or junction points located centrally.\n*   **5 Lines:** There are five hand-drawn strokes connected to or radiating from the nodes:\n    *   **1** horizontal line connecting the two nodes (appearing somewhat faint or broken in the middle).\n    *   **2** lines extending outward to the left from the left node (forming a 'V' shape).\n    *   **2** lines extending outward to the right from the right node (forming a similar 'V' shape).\n\nTogether, these elements form a sketch resembling a simple chemical bond or a graph structure.",
