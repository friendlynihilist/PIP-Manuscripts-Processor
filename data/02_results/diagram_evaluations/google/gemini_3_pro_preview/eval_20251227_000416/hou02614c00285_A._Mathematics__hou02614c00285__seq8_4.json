  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, there are approximately **7 distinct elements** visible, consisting of a mix of shapes, symbols, and lines drawn in pencil and crayon. Here is the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Blue Arrow:** On the left side, there is a blue arrow pointing downwards and to the right.\n2.  **Grey Circle:** In the center, there is a circle drawn in pencil. Inside it, there appears to be a letter **\"Y\"** or a forked line.\n3.  **Orange \"X\":** Overlapping the right side of the grey circle, there is an orange cross or \"X\" shape.\n4.  **Blue Scribble/Loop:** Intertwined with the orange \"X\" is a faint blue looped scribble or circle.\n5.  **Orange \"3\" or \"E\":** To the right, there is an orange shape that resembles the number \"3\" or a backwards letter \"E\".\n6.  **Green Mark:** Next to the orange \"3\", there is a small green dash or leaf-like mark.\n7.  **Grey Lines/Scribbles:** There are faint grey pencil lines and scribbles visible at the top edge and near the blue arrow on the left.",
