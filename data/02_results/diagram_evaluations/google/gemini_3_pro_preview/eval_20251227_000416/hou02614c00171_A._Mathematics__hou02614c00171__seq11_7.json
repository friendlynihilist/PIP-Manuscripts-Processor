  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Shapes:**\n*   **1 Circle:** A large, hand-drawn outer ring enclosing the upper figure.\n*   **1 Rhombus (Diamond):** A four-sided shape located inside the circle.\n*   **1 Triangle:** A separate, smaller shape located below the main circular figure.\n\n**Nodes:**\n*   **4 Nodes:** There are four distinct, dark, filled-in circles (dots) located at the vertices (corners) of the central diamond shape.\n\n**Lines:**\n*   **4 Connecting Lines:** Short, straight lines connect each of the four nodes to the outer circle (top, bottom, left, and right).\n*   **1 Internal Line:** Inside the diamond, there is a horizontal line that appears to be wavy or composed of several small connected dots.\n*   **1 Stray Line:** There is a faint, straight diagonal line in the upper right corner, likely part of a different drawing or a stray mark.\n\n**Summary:**\nIn total, the image features **3 main geometric shapes** (circle, diamond, triangle), **4 distinct nodes**, and various connecting structural lines.",
