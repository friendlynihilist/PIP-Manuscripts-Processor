  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Words (6 elements)**\nThere are five words forming a diagram and one figure label:\n*   **\"millionaire\"** (top)\n*   **\"gives\"** (middle left)\n*   **\"cat\"** (middle right)\n*   **\"zoölogist\"** (inside the inner bubble)\n*   **\"lady\"** (bottom)\n*   **\"Fig 20\"** (bottom left corner)\n\n**2. Shapes (2 elements)**\n*   **Large Outer Oval:** A large, roughly rectangular shape with rounded corners that encloses the words \"gives\" and \"cat,\" as well as the inner shape. It is filled with horizontal hatching lines.\n*   **Inner Oval:** A smaller, clear bubble shape inside the larger one that encloses the word \"zoölogist.\"\n\n**3. Lines and Connectors (3 distinct structures)**\n*   **Curved Hook:** A thick line on the left connecting \"millionaire\" down to \"gives.\"\n*   **Thick Dash:** A heavy horizontal line connecting \"gives\" to \"cat.\"\n*   **Branching Bracket:** A complex vertical line structure below \"gives.\" It connects \"lady\" at the bottom up to \"gives,\" with a horizontal branch pointing to the \"zoölogist\" bubble.\n\n**4. Texture Elements**\n*   **Hatching:** Numerous thin, horizontal hand-drawn lines fill the background of the large outer oval shape to create a shaded effect.",
