  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Text / Labels (6 elements)**\n*   **\"p\"**: A letter located in the upper-left section of the triangle.\n*   **\"q\"**: A letter located to the right of the triangle.\n*   **\"r\"**: A letter located near the central diagonal line.\n*   **\"u\"**: A letter located below the horizontal line on the left side.\n*   **\"y\"**: A letter located at the very bottom, underneath a curly brace.\n*   **\"$\\theta$\" (theta)**: A Greek symbol located inside the angle near the central vertex.\n\n**2. Lines (Approx. 4-5 main segments)**\n*   There are several hand-drawn straight line segments that form the geometric structure.\n    *   A horizontal base line.\n    *   A vertical line extending upwards.\n    *   Two diagonal lines connecting the top of the vertical line to the base, forming triangular shapes.\n\n**3. Arcs / Curves (3 distinct types)**\n*   **Large Arc**: A long curved line on the far left, suggesting a circle or sector.\n*   **Angle Arc**: A small curved line indicating the angle labeled $\\theta$.\n*   **Curly Brace**: A bracket shape at the bottom of the diagram, indicating a length labeled \"y\".\n\n**4. Nodes (1 element)**\n*   There is one distinct, darkened **dot (node)** at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines, serving as the central vertex.\n\n**5. Shapes**\n*   The lines connect to form **triangles** (specifically, it appears to be two right-angled triangles sharing a vertical side).",
