  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Shapes (2 elements):**\n*   **1 Large Outer Oval:** A rough, hand-drawn elliptical shape that forms the boundary of the main diagram.\n*   **1 Smaller Inner Oval:** A smaller hand-drawn oval located inside the upper portion of the larger shape.\n\n**Letters (2 elements):**\n*   **Letter \"A\":** Located in the lower half of the large oval. It is drawn upside down relative to the viewer.\n*   **Letter \"B\":** Located inside the smaller inner oval. It is also drawn upside down.\n\n**Lines (Approx. 18-20 elements):**\n*   **Horizontal Hatching Lines:** There are roughly 18 to 20 horizontal lines drawn to shade the area inside the large oval but outside the small oval. This creates a textured look for the larger set, distinguishing it from the empty space inside the \"B\" circle.\n\n**Background:**\n*   **Grid Lines:** The drawing is on graph paper, so there is a faint grid pattern of vertical and horizontal lines in the background.",
