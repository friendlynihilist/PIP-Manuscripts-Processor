  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Type of Elements:**\nThe image consists entirely of **rough, hand-drawn ink lines** or strokes. There are no typed words, perfect geometric shapes, or smooth arcs. The style resembles a quick sketch or doodle.\n\n**Count and Arrangement:**\nThere are **5 main linear elements** that form the primary structure:\n\n1.  **Vertical Lines (4):** There are four vertical lines of varying lengths and thicknesses.\n    *   The **leftmost line** is thicker at the bottom.\n    *   The **two middle lines** are shorter and somewhat jagged.\n    *   The **rightmost line** is the tallest, extending significantly higher than the others.\n2.  **Horizontal Line (1):** There is one rough horizontal line that intersects all four vertical lines, creating a crossbar effect.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   There are a few smaller, **diagonal marks or \"branches\"** extending from the vertical lines, particularly on the lower half of the second vertical line from the left.\n*   Several line ends are thickened or blob-like, likely due to the ink pooling at the start or end of a stroke.",
