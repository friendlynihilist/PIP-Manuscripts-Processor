Shapes (2 items)**\n*   **Large Oval:** A large, roughly drawn oval shape that encloses the words \"gives,\" \"cat,\" and the smaller oval below.\n*   **Small Oval:** A smaller oval shape specifically enclosing the word \"precious.\"\n\n**3. Lines (3 distinct structural lines + shading)**\n*   **Curved Connector:** A thick, curved line (resembling a hook) connects the word \"millionaire\" to the beginning of the word \"gives.\"\n*   **Vertical Line:** A thick vertical line extends downward from the word \"gives.\"\n*   **Bracket/Connector:** A right-angled line connects the word \"cat\" to the oval containing \"precious.\"\n*   **Hatching Lines:** There are numerous thin, horizontal lines used as shading or filler inside the large oval, surrounding the text.\n\n**4. Background**\n*   **Grid:** The entire drawing is on graph paper, characterized by a grid of light blue squares.",
