  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are approximately **13 distinct mathematical elements** arranged to form a fraction. Here is a breakdown of the kinds of elements present:\n\n**1. Lines:**\n*   **1 Horizontal Fraction Bar:** A long, roughly straight line separating the top and bottom of the equation.\n*   **2 Extended Overlines:** The horizontal parts of the square root symbols that extend over the variables.\n*   **4 Short Intersecting Lines:** These make up the two plus ($+$) signs.\n\n**2. Shapes & Symbols:**\n*   **2 Radical Signs (Square Roots):** These are complex shapes consisting of a \"hook\" or check-mark shape on the left connected to the horizontal line mentioned above.\n*   **4 Greek Letter-like Shapes:**\n    *   Two symbols resembling the letter **Alpha ($\\alpha$)**.\n    *   Two symbols resembling the letter **Beta ($\\beta$)**.\n*   **4 Numerical Shapes:** The number **\"2\"** appears four times as a superscript (exponent).\n\n**3. Arcs & Curves:**\n*   The handwritten letters ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$) and numbers ($2$) are primarily composed of **arcs and loops**.\n*   The left side of the radical signs contains a curved hook.\n\n**4. Miscellaneous:**\n*   **Partial Markings:** There are faint, illegible pencil marks at the very bottom edge of the image, likely the top of another line of text.\n\n**Summary of the Expression:**\nThe image depicts a handwritten mathematical formula that looks like:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2}}{\\sqrt{\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2}} $$\n*(Note: The handwriting is sketchy, so the variables could be interpreted as $a$ and $b$, or $x$ and $y$, but they most closely resemble $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.)*",
