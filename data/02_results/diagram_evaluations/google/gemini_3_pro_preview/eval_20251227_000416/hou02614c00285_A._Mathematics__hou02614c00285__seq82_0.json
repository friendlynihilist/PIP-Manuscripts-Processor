  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Geometric Shapes & Lines:**\n*   **1 Main Quadrilateral:** The central figure is a hand-drawn, roughly rectangular shape standing vertically.\n*   **4 Boundary Lines:** These form the perimeter of the rectangle (top, bottom, left, and right sides). The lines are sketchy, with some consisting of multiple pencil strokes.\n*   **2 Diagonal Lines:** Inside the rectangle, two lines cross from corner to corner, forming an \"X\" shape and dividing the rectangle into four triangular sections.\n\n**2. Alphanumeric Labels (Handwritten Characters):**\nThere are approximately **8 distinct letters or symbols** acting as labels for different parts of the diagram:\n*   **\"a\" (or possibly \"q\"):** Located above the top line.\n*   **\"b\":** Located to the left of the diagram.\n*   **\"d\":** Located to the right of the diagram.\n*   **\"e\" (or similar):** Partially visible below the bottom line.\n*   **\"q\" (or \"9\"):** Inside the rectangle, on the left side.\n*   **\"B\":** Inside the rectangle, in the upper section.\n*   **\"P\":** Inside the rectangle, near the center intersection.\n*   **\"C\":** Inside the rectangle, on the right side.\n\n**3. Other Elements:**\n*   **Partial Markings:** On the far left edge of the image, there are fragments of other characters, including what looks like a large **\"B\"** and a decorative **scroll or hook shape**, likely belonging to adjacent text or diagrams not fully visible.",
