It is filled with horizontal hatching lines.\n2.  **Inner Box:** A smaller, rounded rectangular shape surrounding the word \"zoologist.\" It is also filled with horizontal hatching lines.\n\n**Connecting Lines/Arcs (4 items)**\nThere are four distinct lines connecting the words:\n1.  A curved bracket-like line connecting **\"millionaire\"** down to **\"gives\"**.\n2.  A straight horizontal dash connecting **\"gives\"** to **\"cat\"**.\n3.  A curved line connecting **\"gives\"** down to the first **\"lady\"**.\n4.  A curved line connecting the **\"zoologist\"** box down to the second **\"lady\"**.\n\n**Texture Elements**\n*   **Hatching Lines:** Numerous horizontal sketch lines are used to shade the background of the outer border and the inner \"zoologist\" box.\n*   **Grid:** The entire drawing is on graph paper, indicated by the faint blue grid lines in the background.",
