  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n*   **1 Shape:** The primary element is a single, hand-drawn outline that resembles the shape of an apple or a similar fruit.\n*   **2 Main Arcs/Curved Lines:** The shape is constructed from curved lines. Visually, it consists of two large convex arcs (one on the left and one on the right) that curve inward at the top and bottom to meet, creating the characteristic indentations of the fruit.\n*   **0 Words:** There are no text or words present in the image.\n*   **Background:** The drawing is set against a textured, beige paper background.",
