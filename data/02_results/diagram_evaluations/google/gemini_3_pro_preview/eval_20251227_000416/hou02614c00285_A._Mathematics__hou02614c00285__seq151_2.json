  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Text / Labels (2 items)**\n*   **\"dg\"**: A handwritten label located at the bottom. (Note: It could also be interpreted as \"dy\" or \"dq\" depending on the handwriting style, but \"dg\" is the closest visual match).\n*   **\"dz\"**: A handwritten label located to the right.\n\n**2. Symbols (1 item)**\n*   **Arrow**: There is a single arrow pointing to the right, located just below the triangle and next to the \"dg\" label.\n\n**3. Geometric Lines & Shapes (4 main lines forming 1 shape)**\n*   **Triangle**: There is a triangle shape formed by three lines:\n    *   A **horizontal line** at the bottom.\n    *   A **diagonal line** connecting the left point to the upper right.\n    *   A faint **vertical line** connecting the right ends of the horizontal and diagonal lines.\n*   **Slanted Line**: There is a longer, thicker, slightly curved **slanted line** (or rod) on the right side that intersects with the top of the triangle.\n\n**Summary Count:**\n*   **2** Words/Labels\n*   **1** Arrow\n*   **4** Line segments (forming **1** Triangle shape and **1** separate linear element)",
