  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the sketch, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Geometric Shapes (Closed Loops)**\n*   **3 Overlapping Ovals/Ellipses:** Located on the left side, arranged in a flower-like or Venn diagram pattern.\n*   **2 Circular Forms:** Located on the top right. There is one main circle with tick marks and a smaller, messier loop or circle drawn directly above it.\n\n**2. Linear Elements (Lines and Rays)**\n*   **Radiating Lines:** On the left side, there is a \"starburst\" of approximately **10–15 straight lines** radiating outward from the center where the ovals intersect.\n*   **Dashed/Broken Lines:** On the right side, there are vertical dashed lines extending downward from the circular diagram.\n*   **Intersecting Lines:** In the bottom right corner, there are **2 long straight lines** crossing each other.\n*   **Tick Marks:** There are small hash marks or ticks along the perimeter of the right-hand circle.\n\n**3. Alphanumeric Symbols**\n*   **Numbers:** There are approximately **5 to 6 handwritten digits** visible around and inside the right-hand circle diagram. Clearly visible numbers include a \"6\" inside the circle, a \"1\" and \"2\" outside the circle, and potentially a \"5\" near the top.\n\n**4. Nodes/Intersections**\n*   **Central Node:** The left diagram features a dense central point where the three ovals and multiple radiating lines all intersect.\n*   **Perimeter Nodes:** There are points on the right-hand circle where lines or tick marks intersect the circumference.\n\n**Summary Count:**\n*   **~5** primary geometric shapes (ovals/circles).\n*   **~20+** distinct line segments (radiating, dashed, and intersecting).\n*   **~6** alphanumeric characters (numbers).",
