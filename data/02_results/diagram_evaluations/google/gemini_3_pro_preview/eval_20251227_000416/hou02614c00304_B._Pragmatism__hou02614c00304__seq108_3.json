  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n*   **1 Shape:** There is one large, irregular, hand-drawn **oval** or circular outline that encloses the other elements.\n*   **~18 Lines:** Inside the oval, there are approximately 18 thin, horizontal **lines** that create a hatching or shading effect across the background.\n*   **2 Words:** There are two distinct lines of handwritten **text** in cursive script. One word is positioned in the upper half and the other in the lower half. They appear to be written upside down or mirrored relative to the viewer.\n*   **1 Symbol:** On the right edge of the oval, there is a thicker, dark **symbol** or mark. It resembles a curved vertical line (like a parenthesis) intersected by a short horizontal stroke that extends outside the oval's border.",
