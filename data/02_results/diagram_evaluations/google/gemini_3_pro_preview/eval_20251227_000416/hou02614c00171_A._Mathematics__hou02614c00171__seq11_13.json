  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Total Main Elements:**\n*   **2 distinct hand-drawn figures.**\n\n**Detailed Breakdown by Type:**\n\n1.  **Shapes/Structures:**\n    *   **Left Figure:** A \"Y\" shape or a 3-pronged vertex. It consists of a central point where three lines meet.\n    *   **Right Figure:** A similar 3-pronged structure, but instead of a single central point, it has a small **triangle** in the center.\n\n2.  **Lines:**\n    *   There are **6 main radiating lines** in total (3 extending outwards from the center of each figure).\n    *   The lines are thick, dark, and hand-drawn (likely ink).\n\n3.  **Nodes/Junctions:**\n    *   **Left Figure:** Contains **1 central node** (a solid blot where the lines intersect).\n    *   **Right Figure:** Contains **3 nodes** (the corners of the central triangle) from which the outer lines extend.\n\n4.  **Words/Text:**\n    *   There are **0** words or text elements.\n\nIn summary, the image contains **2 abstract linear shapes** composed of approximately **6 lines** and **1 small triangle**.",
