  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Geometric Shapes & Lines:**\n*   **Main Shape:** A central **quadrilateral**, specifically a **rhombus** or diamond shape, formed by four connected lines.\n*   **Internal Lines:** Two **diagonal lines** connecting the opposite vertices, intersecting at the center of the shape.\n*   **External Lines:** There are two **leader lines** (lines extending outwards) — one extending upwards from the top vertex and another extending upwards and to the right from the right vertex.\n\n**2. Letters (Labels):**\nThere appear to be approximately **10-11 letters** used as labels for vertices, sides, and points:\n*   **Vertices (Corners):**\n    *   **\"H\"** at the left vertex.\n    *   **\"G\"** at the bottom vertex.\n    *   **\"F\"** near the right vertex.\n    *   **\"E\"** connected by a line to the top vertex.\n    *   There is a second **\"E\"** connected by a line to the right vertex.\n*   **Sides/Internal Regions:**\n    *   **\"a\"** near the top-left side.\n    *   **\"b\"** near the center intersection point.\n    *   **\"c\"** near the bottom-right side.\n    *   **\"d\"** (or a similar looped symbol) near the bottom-left side.\n    *   **\"C\"** (or possibly \"L\") near the top-right side.\n\n**3. Nodes/Points:**\n*   **4 Vertices:** The four corner points of the diamond.\n*   **1 Intersection:** The central point where the two diagonals cross. There appears to be a small dot or mark emphasizing this center point.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe image is a hand-drawn geometric sketch containing **1 main diamond shape**, **4 internal/external line segments**, **5 distinct nodes** (corners + center), and roughly **10 alphanumeric labels** scattered around the diagram.",
