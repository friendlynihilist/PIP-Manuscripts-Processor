  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **5 distinct elements** categorized as follows:\n\n*   **2 Words**:\n    *   One word is written upside down between the two shapes, which appears to read **\"Curves\"**.\n    *   Another word (or short text) is scribbled upside down inside the inner oval, which is difficult to decipher but looks like text (possibly \"Rules\" or \"Kills\").\n*   **2 Shapes**:\n    *   There is a large, hand-drawn **outer circle** (or irregular oval).\n    *   There is a smaller **inner oval** positioned within the upper half of the larger circle.\n*   **1 Line**:\n    *   There is a single **horizontal line** (drawn in segments) that runs through the center of the diagram, extending outwards to the left and right.",
