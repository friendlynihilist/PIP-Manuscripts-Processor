  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the sketch, the image contains the following elements:\n\n**1. Lines (Approx. 10-12 distinct strokes)**\nThe drawing is primarily composed of rough, hand-drawn pencil lines.\n*   **Boundary Lines:** There are **4** main lines forming the outer rectangular border (top, bottom, left, right).\n*   **Dividing Lines:** There is **1** horizontal line running across the middle and **1** vertical line splitting the top section in half.\n*   **Detail Lines:** There are additional vertical strokes on the left side to create a \"pole\" effect and about **3** short strokes forming a symbol in the top right.\n\n**2. Shapes**\n*   **Rectangles:** The overall shape is a **rectangle**. Inside, the dividing lines create **3 smaller rectangular sections** (a large bottom section and two smaller top quadrants).\n*   **Cylinder / Pole:** On the far left, a double vertical line creates a narrow, column-like shape, suggesting a pole or a rolled edge.\n*   **Oval / Loop:** At the top of the \"pole\" section on the left, there is a small, roughly drawn **oval** or circle.\n*   **Symbol / Figure:** In the top-right rectangular section, there is a small abstract shape resembling a stick figure, a rune, or a branched stick.\n\n**3. No Words or Text**\nThere are no discernible words, letters, or numbers present in the image.",
