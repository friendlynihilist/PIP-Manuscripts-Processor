  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Letters (4 items)**\nThere are four handwritten letters acting as labels for the geometric points:\n*   **\"A\"**: Located at the bottom left vertex.\n*   **\"B\"**: Located at the bottom center, at the base of the vertical line.\n*   **\"V\"**: Located at the top vertex.\n*   **\"e\"** (or possibly a stylized \"C\"): Located at the bottom right vertex.\n\n**2. Straight Lines (Approx. 7 distinct segments)**\nThe image is a sketch composed of several pencil strokes representing geometric line segments:\n*   **Vertical Line:** One strong vertical line connecting point B to V.\n*   **Horizontal/Base Lines:** Lines connecting A to B and B to e.\n*   **Slanted Lines:** One connecting A to V, and another connecting V to e.\n*   **Faint Lines:** There are lighter, sketchier lines to the left of the main figure that form a smaller, incomplete triangle.\n\n**3. Arcs (1 item)**\n*   There is **one** large, faint, semi-circular arc drawn above the main triangle, curving from the left side over towards the vertical line.\n\n**4. Shapes (2 main forms)**\n*   **Main Triangle:** The primary figure is a large triangle divided into two smaller right-angled triangles by the vertical line (altitude).\n*   **Faint Triangle:** There is a smaller, ghost-like triangle sketched faintly near point A.",
