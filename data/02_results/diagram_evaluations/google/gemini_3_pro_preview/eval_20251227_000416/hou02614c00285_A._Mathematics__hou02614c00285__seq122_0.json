  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Letters (4 elements)**\n*   **\"A\"**: Located at the bottom left vertex.\n*   **\"B\"**: Located at the bottom center, marking the base of the vertical line.\n*   **\"V\"**: Located at the top vertex.\n*   **\"e\" or \"C\"**: Located at the bottom right vertex. It resembles a lowercase \"e\" but likely represents the point \"C\" in a geometric context.\n\n**2. Lines (Main Structural Lines)**\nThere are **4 main straight line segments** that make up the primary geometric figure:\n*   A diagonal line connecting A to V.\n*   A vertical line connecting B to V.\n*   A diagonal line connecting V to the point on the right (e/C).\n*   A horizontal base line connecting A to the point on the right, passing through B.\n\n*Note: There are also several faint, \"ghost\" lines or erased sketch marks, including a smaller triangle shape sketched faintly inside the main figure near point A.*\n\n**3. Shapes**\nThe lines form **3 triangular shapes**:\n*   Triangle ABV (The left triangle).\n*   Triangle VBe (The right triangle).\n*   Triangle AVe (The large composite triangle formed by the two smaller ones).\n\n**4. Arcs**\n*   There is **1 large, faint arc** drawn above the main triangle, curving from the left side over the top.",
