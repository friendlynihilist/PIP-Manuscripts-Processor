  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Quantity:** There are **2 main distinct shapes** or groupings of lines.\n\n**Kind of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Rough Circular Shape:** On the left side, there is a hand-drawn, sketchy circle or oval. It is formed by a thin, curved line that doesn't perfectly close at the bottom.\n2.  **Wavy Line Structure (Arcs):** Extending to the right of the circle, there is a shape composed of curved lines. It features:\n    *   **Two connected arcs** or humps on the top.\n    *   A **curved horizontal line** underneath connecting the ends of the arcs.\n    *   Together, these lines create a shape resembling a pair of lips, a mustache, or rolling hills.\n\n**Summary:** The image consists entirely of **hand-drawn pencil lines** forming **one circular shape** and **one bi-lobed shape made of arcs**. There are no words, distinct nodes, or geometric polygons present.",
