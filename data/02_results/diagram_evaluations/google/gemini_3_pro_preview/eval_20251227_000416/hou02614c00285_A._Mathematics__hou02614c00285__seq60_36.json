  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **2 shapes**.\n\nSpecifically, they appear to be:\n1.  A rough, hand-drawn **pentagon** (or irregular polygon) on the left.\n2.  A rough, hand-drawn **oval** (or circle) on the right.\n\nThere is also a faint vertical line or crease separating them, but the primary elements are the two shapes.",
