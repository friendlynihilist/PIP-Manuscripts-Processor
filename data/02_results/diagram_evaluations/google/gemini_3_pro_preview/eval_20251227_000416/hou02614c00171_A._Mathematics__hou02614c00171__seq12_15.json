  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **5 distinct elements** visible:\n\n1.  **Outer Shape**: One large, hand-drawn, irregular closed loop that resembles a rounded square or a distorted circle.\n2.  **Inner Shape**: One smaller, darker, and thicker oval or circle positioned roughly in the center of the outer shape.\n3.  **Curved Line (Arc)**: One curved line segment along the left side of the outer shape, running parallel to the edge, which creates a double-line or \"thickness\" effect on that side.\n4.  **Straight Line**: One short, horizontal line segment extending outward from the left side of the outer shape, resembling a pointer or leader line.\n5.  **Text Fragments**: Traces of handwritten words are visible at the very top edge of the image, though they are cut off and illegible.",
