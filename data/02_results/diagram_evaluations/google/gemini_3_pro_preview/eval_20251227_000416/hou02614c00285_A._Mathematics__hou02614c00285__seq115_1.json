  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**Total Elements: Approximately 10 distinct components**\n\nHere is the categorization of those elements:\n\n1.  **Shapes (2 elements):**\n    *   **1 Large Outer Circle:** An irregular, hand-drawn circle that acts as the main boundary for the sketch.\n    *   **1 Small Oval/Loop:** Located in the lower-right quadrant of the circle, intersecting one of the lines.\n\n2.  **Lines (5 elements):**\n    *   **4 Radial Lines:** These act like spokes on a wheel, radiating from the center point outwards toward the edge of the circle, dividing it into sections.\n    *   **1 Horizontal Line:** A straight line that crosses through the upper part of the circle, intersecting the top vertical radial line.\n\n3.  **Nodes (1 element):**\n    *   **1 Central Point:** A darkened, scribbled intersection in the middle where the radial lines meet.\n\n4.  **Symbols/Scribbles (2 elements):**\n    *   **Left Quadrant:** A squiggly mark that resembles the number \"2\", a backwards \"S\", or a Greek letter.\n    *   **Right Quadrant:** A squiggly mark that resembles the letter \"S\" or the number \"5\".",
