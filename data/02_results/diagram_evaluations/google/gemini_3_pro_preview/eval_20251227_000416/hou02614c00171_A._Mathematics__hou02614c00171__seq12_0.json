  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, there are **7 distinct elements** present, which can be categorized as follows:\n\n*   **1 Circle:** A large, hand-drawn circular outline that encloses the other elements.\n*   **2 Loops:** Inside the circle, there are two loop shapes connected at the center, resembling a propeller or a figure-eight. The left loop is drawn with a thicker line than the right one.\n*   **1 Node:** A small, filled central dot where the two loops connect.\n*   **3 Lines:** There are three small linear marks located at the top left of the inner figure: one line crosses the loop, and two smaller parallel hash marks are positioned just above it.",
