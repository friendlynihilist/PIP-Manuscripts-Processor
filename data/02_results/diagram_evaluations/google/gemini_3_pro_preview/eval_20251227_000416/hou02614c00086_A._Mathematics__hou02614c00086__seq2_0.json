  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n*   **1 Shape:** The most prominent element is a hand-drawn geometric shape, specifically an **irregular quadrilateral** (a four-sided polygon) that resembles a trapezoid.\n*   **6 Lines:**\n    *   There are **4 dark, distinct lines** that form the perimeter of the main quadrilateral shape.\n    *   There are **2 fainter, sketchy lines** extending to the left from the top and bottom corners, suggesting an attempt to draw a 3D perspective (like the side of a cube) or a shadow. One of these lines is wavy/curved.\n*   **1 Smudge/Mark:** There is a small, brownish spot or smudge located just above the top-left corner of the drawing.",
