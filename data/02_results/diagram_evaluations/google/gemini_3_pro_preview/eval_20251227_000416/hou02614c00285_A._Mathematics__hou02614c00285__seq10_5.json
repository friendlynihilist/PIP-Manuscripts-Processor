  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **3 distinct groups of elements**:\n\n1.  **One irregular closed shape**: This is the main element in the center, appearing as a hand-drawn, rough loop or polygon (somewhat circular or hexagonal).\n2.  **One curved line segment**: Located at the very top edge of the image, this appears to be the bottom fragment of another similar shape.\n3.  **Internal markings/scribbles**: Inside the central shape, there are indistinct dark strokes. These look like two small, vertical-oriented scribbles or symbols, though they are not clearly legible as specific letters or numbers.",
