  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **3 distinct drawn elements** visible:\n\n1.  **1 Shape**: The most prominent element is a rough, irregular **circular or oval loop**. It appears hand-drawn with a sketchy quality.\n2.  **1 Line/Mark**: Inside the loop, there is a **squiggly curved line**. It is abstract but somewhat resembles a number \"5,\" a letter \"S,\" or a simple doodle.\n3.  **1 Arc**: At the very bottom edge of the image, there is a partial **curved line or arc**, which looks like the top portion of another shape that has been cut off.",
