  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Numbers (Digits)**\n*   **Quantity:** 6\n*   **Description:** There are six hand-written digits labeled **1, 2, 3, 4, 5,** and **6**. They act as labels for the vertices (corners) of the shape.\n\n**2. Lines (Segments)**\n*   **Quantity:** 6\n*   **Description:** There are six hand-drawn line segments that connect the numbers in a sequential loop.\n    *   Line from 1 to 2\n    *   Line from 2 to 3\n    *   Line from 3 to 4\n    *   Line from 4 to 5\n    *   Line from 5 to 6\n    *   Line from 6 back to 1\n\n**3. Nodes (Vertices)**\n*   **Quantity:** 6\n*   **Description:** The points where the lines meet (and where the numbers are placed) act as the nodes of the diagram.\n\n**4. Shape**\n*   **Quantity:** 1\n*   **Description:** The connected lines form a single, continuous, self-intersecting geometric polygon. It visually resembles two mountain peaks or two overlapping triangles.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe image consists of **1 geometric shape** formed by **6 line segments** connecting **6 numbered nodes**.",
