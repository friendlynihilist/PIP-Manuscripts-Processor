  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, the elements present can be broken down as follows:\n\n*   **1 Continuous Curved Line:** The primary element is a single, hand-drawn dark line that forms the entire figure.\n*   **2 Internal Loops:** The line twists to create two distinct smaller loops—one hanging down from the top and one pointing up from the bottom.\n*   **2 Intersection Points (Nodes):** There are two specific points where the line crosses over itself to form the loops mentioned above.\n*   **Small Dashes/Marks:** At the top-left section of the shape, the line is broken, consisting of **2-3 small dash-like marks** where the segments join, rather than a solid stroke.\n*   **1 Overall Shape:** The combination of these elements creates a single, closed, irregular shape that resembles a distorted circle or a topological knot diagram.",
