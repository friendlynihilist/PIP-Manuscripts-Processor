  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, there are **5 distinct hand-drawn elements** present on the graph paper. They can be categorized as follows:\n\n1.  **Shapes (2 elements):**\n    *   **Outer Oval:** A large, roughly circular hand-drawn loop that encloses the other content.\n    *   **Inner Oval:** A smaller, roughly oval shape drawn inside the upper portion of the large outer oval.\n\n2.  **Words/Text (2 elements):**\n    *   **Upper Text:** Handwritten cursive text inside the smaller inner oval. It appears to be written upside down relative to the viewer. (It looks somewhat like \"is hampe\" or \"is sample\").\n    *   **Lower Text:** The handwritten word **\"skills\"** (written as \"-skills\") located in the lower part of the large oval. This text is also upside down.\n\n3.  **Lines/Arrows (1 element):**\n    *   **Arrow:** A straight line with an arrowhead pointing from the right side of the image inwards, directing attention to the text inside the inner oval.",
