  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1 Shape:**\n*   There is **one** main, central shape. It is fusiform (spindle-shaped), resembling a diamond with curved sides that tapers to a point at both the top and bottom. It looks like a drawing of a spindle or bobbin wound with thread.\n\n**Lines:**\n*   **Numerous horizontal lines:** The interior of the shape is filled with many horizontal sketching lines (hatching). These are used to create texture and shading, suggesting layers of wound material.\n*   **Contour lines:** Thick, dark, irregular lines form the outer boundary of the shape.\n*   **One diagonal line:** There is a distinct, darker line running slightly diagonally through the left-center of the shape.\n\n**Points/Tips:**\n*   **Two points:** The shape terminates in two sharp, dark tips—one at the very top and one at the very bottom.\n\n**Arcs:**\n*   **Two main arcs:** The silhouette of the object is formed by two convex curves (arcs) on the left and right sides that meet at the top and bottom points.\n\n**Words:**\n*   There are **zero** words or text elements in the image.",
