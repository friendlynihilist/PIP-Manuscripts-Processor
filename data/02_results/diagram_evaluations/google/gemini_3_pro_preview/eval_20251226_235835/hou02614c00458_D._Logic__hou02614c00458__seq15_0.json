  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image provided, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Words (4 items)**\nThere are four distinct handwritten words visible in the diagram:\n*   **\"man\"**: Located on the far left.\n*   **\"man\"**: Located inside the top loop (part of the phrase \"man disgraced\").\n*   **\"disgraced\"**: Located inside the top loop, following \"man\".\n*   **\"wounded\"**: Located below the top phrase.\n\n**2. Shapes (2 items)**\nThere are two hand-drawn enclosing shapes:\n*   **Inner Oval:** An irregular oval shape encircling the phrase \"man disgraced\".\n*   **Outer Loop:** A larger, rougher loop that encircles both the inner oval and the word \"wounded\" below it.\n\n**3. Lines (1 item)**\n*   **Branching Connector:** There is one thick, dark connecting line that starts from the word \"man\" on the left. It splits into two branches:\n    *   One branch curves upward to underline/connect to the \"man\" inside the loop.\n    *   One branch curves downward to point to the word \"wounded\".\n\n**Summary:**\nIn total, the image contains **7 distinct graphic elements**: 4 words, 2 shapes, and 1 branching line. These elements are drawn on lined notebook paper.",
