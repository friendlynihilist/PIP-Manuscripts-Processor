  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Based on the image, here is a breakdown of the elements present:\n\n**1. Words (4 items)**\nThere are four handwritten words in cursive script:\n*   **\"man\"** (appearing on the far left)\n*   **\"man\"** (appearing again inside a small circle)\n*   **\"disgraced\"** (top right)\n*   **\"wounded\"** (bottom right)\n\n**2. Shapes (2 items)**\nThere are two hand-drawn enclosing shapes:\n*   A **small oval/circle** encircling the inner word \"man\".\n*   A **large, irregular loop** (roughly rectangular with rounded corners) encircling the entire right-hand portion of the diagram (\"man disgraced\" and \"wounded\").\n\n**3. Lines and Arcs (2 main items)**\nThere are structural lines connecting the words:\n*   A **horizontal line** connecting the first \"man\" on the left to the rest of the diagram.\n*   A **curved bracket or brace** (arc) that splits the path into two levels, connecting the subject to both \"disgraced\" and \"wounded\".\n\n**4. Background Elements**\n*   **Horizontal blue lines** typical of lined notebook paper are visible in the background.",
