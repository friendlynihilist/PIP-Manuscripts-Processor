There is only one closed curve present in the diagram.",

      "response": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside:** The text label \"man\" (lower instance) and the text label \"wounded\" are contained within a single, elongated oval loop.\n*   **Outside:** A second text label \"man\" (upper instance) is located outside the oval, positioned above the top-left section of the curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   Inside the oval, a horizontal line segment connects the word \"man\" on the left to the word \"wounded\" on the right.\n*   A vertical line intersects the center of this horizontal line, rising upwards to form an inverted \"T\" shape.\n*   The \"man\" text outside the oval has a small horizontal dash to its right, but it is not connected by any drawn line to the oval or the text inside it.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The vertical line that originates from the horizontal connector inside the oval extends upwards and crosses the top boundary of the closed curve, ending outside the oval.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There are no closed curves nested inside others; there is only one single closed curve visible.",
