  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside:** The text label \"wounded\" and the lower instance of the text label \"man\" are situated inside the single, roughly oval-shaped closed curve.\n*   **Outside:** The upper instance of the text label \"man\" is positioned outside the closed curve, located above the left side of the oval.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   There is a thick, vertical, slightly curved line connecting the two instances of the word \"man.\" It appears to link the end of the upper \"man\" to the beginning of the lower \"man.\"\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   Yes, the vertical line connecting the upper \"man\" to the lower \"man\" crosses the top boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   No closed curves are nested inside others. There is only one closed curve present in the diagram.",
