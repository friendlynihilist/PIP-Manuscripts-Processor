  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outer Closed Curve:** The text labels \"man\", \"rational\", and \"animal\" are all contained within the larger, outer boundary line.\n*   **Inner Closed Curve:** The text labels \"rational\" and \"animal\" are contained inside the smaller, inner boundary line. The label \"man\" is outside this inner curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A thick, horizontal dash connects the word \"man\" to a large, bold \"C\" shape (or bracket).\n*   This \"C\" shape is positioned vertically to encompass the stacked words \"rational\" and \"animal\" to its right.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal connecting line between \"man\" and the \"C\" shape crosses the left boundary line of the inner closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is a smaller closed curve nested completely inside a larger closed curve. The smaller curve is positioned on the right side of the larger enclosure.",
