      "response": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Top Diagram:** There is a large outer oval that contains the text \"man\" on the left and a smaller inner oval on the right. The text \"animal\" is contained entirely within this smaller inner oval. Therefore, \"man\" is inside the outer curve but outside the inner curve.\n*   **Bottom Diagram:** Similarly, there is a large outer oval containing the text \"man\" on the left and a smaller inner oval on the right. The text \"rational\" is contained entirely within this smaller inner oval. \"Man\" is inside the outer curve but outside the inner curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   **Top Diagram:** A thick, dark horizontal line connects the word \"man\" to the word \"animal\".\n*   **Bottom Diagram:** A thick, dark horizontal line connects the word \"man\" to the word \"rational\".\n*   There are no branching lines or unconnected lines visible.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   In both the top and bottom diagrams, the connecting line crosses the boundary of the inner, smaller oval. The line starts at \"man\" (outside the inner oval) and crosses into the inner oval to reach the second word (\"animal\" or \"rational\"). The lines do not cross the large outer boundaries.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   Both diagrams feature a nested structure where a smaller closed oval curve is positioned inside the right-hand side of a larger, elongated closed oval curve.",

In the lower section, an identical structure exists with a separate small closed curve nested inside a separate larger closed curve.",
