  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   The handwritten text label \"isounded\" is located entirely inside the single, elongated closed curve (oval).\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   There are no connections between distinct text labels, as only one label is present.\n*   There is a horizontal line segment aligned with the text. It appears to the left of the word \"isounded\" but does not connect to any other object on the left side of the image.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   Yes, a thick horizontal line crosses the left-hand boundary of the closed curve. It extends from the space outside the curve into the interior space.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There are no closed curves nested inside others; only one closed curve is visible.",
