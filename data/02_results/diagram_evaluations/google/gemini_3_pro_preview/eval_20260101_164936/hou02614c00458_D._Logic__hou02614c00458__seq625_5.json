  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram, here are the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outer Curve:** The text label \"man\" is inside the larger, outer closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text labels \"rational\" and \"animal\" are inside the smaller, inner closed curve.\n*   **Relative Position:** \"man\" is located within the outer curve but outside the inner curve. \"rational\" and \"animal\" are contained within both the inner and outer curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   There is a short horizontal line extending from the right side of the word \"man\".\n*   This line connects to the center of a vertical, C-shaped bracket (or brace).\n*   The bracket is positioned to the left of the words \"rational\" and \"animal\", effectively spanning the vertical space between them.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line connecting \"man\" to the bracket crosses the boundary line of the inner closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There are two closed curves roughly shaped like ovals.\n*   The smaller oval is fully nested inside the right side of the larger oval.",
