  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT:**\nThe handwritten text label \"werunder\" is contained inside a single, horizontally oriented oval-shaped closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\nA thick, dark horizontal line connects to the beginning (left side) of the text label \"werunder\". This line appears to lead directly into the first letter of the word. There are no branching lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\nYes, the thick horizontal line on the left crosses the boundary of the closed curve. It originates outside the oval on the left side and passes through the boundary line to connect with the text inside.\n\n**NESTING:**\nThere are no closed curves nested inside others. There is only one closed curve visible in the diagram.",
