  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the visual evidence in the diagram, here are the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outer Curve:** Contains the text label \"man\" as well as the inner curve and its contents.\n*   **Inner Curve:** Contains the text labels \"rational\" and \"animal\".\n*   **Relative Position:** The label \"man\" is inside the outer curve but outside the inner curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A thick horizontal line extends from the right side of the word \"man\".\n*   This line connects to a vertical bracket or brace shape (resembling a \"C\") located to the left of the words \"rational\" and \"animal\".\n*   The bracket branches vertically to encompass both \"rational\" (top) and \"animal\" (bottom).\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line connecting \"man\" to the bracket crosses the boundary line of the inner closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There are two closed curves, roughly oval in shape.\n*   The smaller curve (containing \"rational\" and \"animal\") is nested entirely inside the larger curve.",
