  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Top Diagram:** There is a large outer oval that contains the text \"man\" on the left and a smaller inner oval on the right. The text \"animal\" is contained entirely within this smaller inner oval. Therefore, \"man\" is inside the outer curve but outside the inner curve.\n*   **Bottom Diagram:** Similarly, there is a large outer oval containing the text \"man\" on the left and a smaller inner oval on the right. The text \"rational\" is contained entirely within this smaller inner oval. \"Man\" is inside the outer curve but outside the inner curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   **Top Diagram:** A thick, dark horizontal line connects the word \"man\" to the word \"animal\".\n*   **Bottom Diagram:** A thick, dark horizontal line connects the word \"man\" to the word \"rational\".\n*   There are no branching lines or unconnected lines visible.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   In both the top and bottom diagrams, the connecting line crosses the boundary of the inner, smaller oval. The line starts at \"man\" (outside the inner oval) and crosses into the inner oval to reach the second word (\"animal\" or \"rational\"). The lines do not cross the large outer boundaries.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   Both diagrams feature a nested structure where a smaller closed oval curve is positioned inside the right-hand side of a larger, elongated closed oval curve.",
