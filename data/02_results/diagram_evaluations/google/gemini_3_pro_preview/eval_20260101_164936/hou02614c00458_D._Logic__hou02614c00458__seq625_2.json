  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is the description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Top Section:** There is a large, elongated closed curve (oval). Inside this large curve, there is the text label \"snake\" and a smaller, nested closed curve. Inside that smaller nested curve is the text label \"fears\".\n*   **Bottom Section:** There is a second large, elongated closed curve. Inside this curve, there is the text label \"snake\" and a smaller, nested closed curve. Inside that smaller nested curve is the text label \"hates\".\n*   **Outside:** The text label \"man\" is located to the far left, outside of all closed curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A curved, branching line originates from the label \"man\". It splits into two branches:\n    *   The upper branch connects \"man\" to the label \"fears\".\n    *   The lower branch connects \"man\" to the label \"hates\".\n*   Inside the top large curve, a thick, straight horizontal line connects the label \"fears\" to the top label \"snake\".\n*   Inside the bottom large curve, a thick, straight horizontal line connects the label \"hates\" to the bottom label \"snake\".\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The curved line connecting \"man\" to \"fears\" crosses two boundaries: the left side of the top large outer curve and the left side of the top small inner curve.\n*   The curved line connecting \"man\" to \"hates\" crosses two boundaries: the left side of the bottom large outer curve and the left side of the bottom small inner curve.\n*   The straight line connecting \"fears\" to the top \"snake\" crosses the right boundary of the small inner curve surrounding \"fears\".\n*   The straight line connecting \"hates\" to the bottom \"snake\" crosses the right boundary of the small inner curve surrounding \"hates\".\n\n**NESTING**\n*   In the top section, the small closed curve surrounding \"fears\" is nested entirely inside the larger closed curve.\n*   In the bottom section, the small closed curve surrounding \"hates\" is nested entirely inside the larger closed curve.",
