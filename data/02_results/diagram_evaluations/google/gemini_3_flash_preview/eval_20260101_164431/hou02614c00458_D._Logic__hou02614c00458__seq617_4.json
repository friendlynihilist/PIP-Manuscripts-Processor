  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a spatial description of the diagram:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside:** The text label \"wounded\" is located inside the single closed curve (an oval).\n*   **Outside:** The text label \"man\" is located outside the closed curve, to its left.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   There are two short, horizontal line segments.\n*   One line segment is positioned to the right of the word \"man.\" It is not physically connected to any text or other lines.\n*   The second line segment is positioned to the left of the word \"wounded.\" It is not physically connected to any text or other lines.\n*   There are no branching lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   No lines cross the boundary of the closed curve. Both line segments and both text labels are entirely contained either inside or outside the curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is only one closed curve; therefore, there is no nesting.",
