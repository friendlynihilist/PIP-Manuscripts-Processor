  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n*   **CONTAINMENT:** The text label \"wounded\" is inside the single closed curve. The text label \"man\" is outside the closed curve.\n*   **CONNECTIONS:** A single horizontal line segment connects the text label \"man\" to the text label \"wounded.\" There are no branching or unconnected lines.\n*   **BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:** The horizontal line segment crosses the left boundary of the closed curve as it travels from \"man\" to \"wounded.\"\n*   **NESTING:** There is only one closed curve; therefore, there is no nesting.",
