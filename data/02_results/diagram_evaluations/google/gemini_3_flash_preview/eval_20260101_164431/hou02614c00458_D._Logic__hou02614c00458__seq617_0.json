  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inner closed curve:** Contains the text label \"respects\".\n*   **Outer closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"man\" and \"American\", as well as the inner closed curve and all connecting lines.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line connects the text label \"man\" on the left to the text label \"American\" on the right.\n*   Two vertical lines branch upward from this horizontal line.\n*   The left vertical line connects the horizontal line to the left side of the text label \"respects\".\n*   The right vertical line connects the horizontal line to the right side of the text label \"respects\".\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The two vertical lines cross the boundary of the inner closed curve to reach the text label \"respects\".\n*   No lines cross the boundary of the outer closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The inner closed curve (containing \"respects\") is entirely nested within the outer closed curve.",
