  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is the spatial description of the diagram:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inner closed curve:** Contains the text label \"respects\".\n*   **Outer closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"man\", \"respects\", and \"American\".\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line segment connects the label \"man\" to the label \"respects\".\n*   A horizontal line segment connects the label \"respects\" to the label \"American\".\n*   There are no branching lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The line segment between \"man\" and \"respects\" crosses the left boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   The line segment between \"respects\" and \"American\" crosses the right boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   No lines cross the boundary of the outer closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The inner closed curve (surrounding \"respects\") is nested entirely within the outer closed curve.",
