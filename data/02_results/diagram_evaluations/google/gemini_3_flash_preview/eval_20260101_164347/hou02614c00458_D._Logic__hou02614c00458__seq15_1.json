  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a spatial description of the diagram:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside the inner closed curve:** The text label \"disgraced\" is contained within the smaller, inner oval.\n*   **Inside the outer closed curve:** Both text labels \"disgraced\" and \"wounded\" are contained within the larger, outer oval.\n*   **Outside all closed curves:** The text label \"man\" is located to the left of both closed curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line extends from the right side of the word \"man.\"\n*   This line branches into a large, bold, C-shaped bracket.\n*   The top end of this bracket points toward the word \"disgraced.\"\n*   The bottom end of this bracket points toward the word \"wounded.\"\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line originating from \"man\" crosses the boundary of the outer closed curve.\n*   The top branch of the C-shaped bracket crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve to point at \"disgraced.\"\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is one instance of nesting: the smaller closed curve (containing \"disgraced\") is entirely nested within the larger outer closed curve.",
