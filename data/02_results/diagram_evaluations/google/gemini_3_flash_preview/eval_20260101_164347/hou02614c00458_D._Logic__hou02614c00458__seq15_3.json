  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided diagram, here are the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inner closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"man\" and \"disgraced\".\n*   **Outer closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"man\", \"disgraced\", and \"wounded\".\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line segment connects the text \"man\" and \"disgraced\".\n*   A vertical line segment branches downward from the center of the \"man-disgraced\" line.\n*   This vertical line connects to a second horizontal line.\n*   The second horizontal line connects to the text \"wounded\" on its right side.\n*   The left side of the second horizontal line extends outward and does not connect to any text.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The vertical line segment crosses the bottom boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   The lower horizontal line crosses the left boundary of the outer closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The inner closed curve is entirely nested within the outer closed curve.",
