  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the spatial layout of the diagram, here is a description of the relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Top closed curve:** Contains the word \"wounded\". The word \"man\" is outside to the left.\n*   **Middle closed curve (inner):** Contains the word \"man\".\n*   **Middle closed curve (outer):** Contains the inner \"man\" curve and the word \"disgraced\".\n*   **Bottom closed curve:** Contains the middle curves (and their contents) as well as the word \"wounded\". A second instance of the word \"man\" is outside to the left.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   **Top row:** A thick horizontal line connects the exterior \"man\" to the interior \"wounded\".\n*   **Bottom section:** A thick line originates from the exterior \"man\". It branches into two paths:\n    *   One branch goes upward to connect to the word \"disgraced\".\n    *   One branch goes downward to connect to the word \"wounded\".\n*   The word \"man\" inside the nested circles is not connected to any lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   **Top row:** The line connecting \"man\" to \"wounded\" crosses the boundary of the top closed curve.\n*   **Bottom section:** The main line from the exterior \"man\" crosses the boundary of the largest (outermost) closed curve. \n*   The upper branch of that line then crosses the boundary of the middle closed curve to reach the word \"disgraced\".\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is a three-level nesting structure in the bottom half of the diagram:\n    1.  An innermost curve (containing \"man\").\n    2.  A middle curve that encloses the innermost curve.\n    3.  A large outer curve that encloses both the middle and innermost curves.\n*   The top closed curve is separate and not nested.",
