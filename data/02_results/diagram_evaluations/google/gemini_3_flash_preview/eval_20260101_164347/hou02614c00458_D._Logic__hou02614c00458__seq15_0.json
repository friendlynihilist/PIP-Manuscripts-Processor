  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a spatial description of the diagram:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inner closed curve:** Contains the text \"man disgraced\".\n*   **Outer closed curve:** Contains the text \"wounded\" and the inner closed curve (which itself contains \"man disgraced\").\n*   **Outside all curves:** The text \"man\" is located to the left, outside both closed curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A thick line originates from the text **\"man\"** (outside the curves).\n*   This line branches into two paths:\n    1.  One branch extends upward and connects to the text **\"man disgraced\"**.\n    2.  The other branch extends downward and connects to the text **\"wounded\"**.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The line originating from \"man\" crosses the boundary of the **outer closed curve**.\n*   The upward branch of that line then crosses the boundary of the **inner closed curve** to reach \"man disgraced\".\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is one instance of nesting: the smaller, inner closed curve is entirely contained within the larger, outer closed curve.",
