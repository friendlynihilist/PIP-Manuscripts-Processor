  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside the closed curve:** The text label \"wounded\" is contained within the elongated oval-shaped closed curve.\n*   **Outside the closed curve:** The text label \"man\" is located to the left of and outside the closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A continuous, wavy horizontal line connects the text label \"man\" to the text label \"wounded.\"\n*   This line passes through a thick, dark horizontal stroke (a strike-through) located between the two words.\n*   There are no branching lines; it is a single linear path.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line connecting the two words crosses the left boundary of the closed curve to reach the word \"wounded.\"\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is only one closed curve visible in this crop; therefore, there is no nesting of closed curves.",
