  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a spatial description of the diagram:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inner-most curve (top left):** Contains the text label \"man\".\n*   **Middle curve (top):** Contains the text label \"disgraced\" (or \"disgracer\").\n*   **Outer-most curve:** Contains the text label \"wounded\".\n*   **Outside all curves:** There is a text label \"man\" located to the far left of the diagram.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A thick, dark line connects the \"man\" label on the far left to a central branching point.\n*   From this central point, the line branches in two directions:\n    1.  One branch goes upward and connects to the \"man\" label inside the inner-most curve.\n    2.  The other branch goes downward and connects to the \"wounded\" label.\n*   The label \"disgraced\" appears to be connected to the inner \"man\" label by a thin horizontal line extending from the end of the word \"man\".\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The thick line originating from the leftmost \"man\" crosses the boundary of the outer-most curve to enter the diagram.\n*   The upward branch of that line crosses the boundaries of both the middle curve and the inner-most curve to reach the inner \"man\" label.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The curves are nested hierarchically:\n    *   The inner-most curve (containing \"man\") is nested inside the middle curve.\n    *   The middle curve (containing \"disgraced\") is nested inside the top portion of the outer-most curve.\n    *   The outer-most curve encompasses all other curves and the label \"wounded\".",
