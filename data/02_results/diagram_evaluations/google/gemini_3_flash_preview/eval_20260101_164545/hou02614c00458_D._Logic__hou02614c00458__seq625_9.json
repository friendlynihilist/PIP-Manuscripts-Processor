  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside:** The text label \"isrounded\" is located entirely within the single closed curve.\n*   **Outside:** There are no text labels located outside the closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   There is a single horizontal line segment on the left side of the diagram.\n*   This line is not connected to any text labels.\n*   There are no branching lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line segment on the left crosses the boundary of the closed curve. Approximately half of the line is outside the curve, and half is inside.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is only one closed curve; therefore, there is no nesting of curves.",
