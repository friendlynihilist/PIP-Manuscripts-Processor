  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside:** The text label \"werunder\" is located inside a single, elongated closed curve.\n*   **Outside:** There are no text labels outside of the closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A thick, dark horizontal line segment is located to the left of the text label.\n*   This horizontal line is connected to the left side of the closed curve.\n*   The text label \"werunder\" is written in a cursive script where the individual letters are connected to one another.\n*   The final letter of the text label has a line that extends upward and to the right, ending in a small hook, but it does not connect to any other element.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The thick horizontal line on the left crosses the boundary of the closed curve, with a portion of the line existing both outside and inside the curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is only one closed curve; therefore, there is no nesting of curves.",
