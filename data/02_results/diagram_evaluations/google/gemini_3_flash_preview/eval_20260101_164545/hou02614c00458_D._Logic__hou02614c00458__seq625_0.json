  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a spatial description of the diagram:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\nThe diagram consists of two similar horizontal groupings, one above the other.\n*   **Top Grouping:** The text label \"man\" is inside a large outer closed curve. The text label \"animal\" is inside a smaller inner closed curve.\n*   **Bottom Grouping:** The text label \"man\" is inside a large outer closed curve. The text label \"rational\" is inside a smaller inner closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   In the top grouping, a thick horizontal line connects the label \"man\" to the label \"animal.\"\n*   In the bottom grouping, a thick horizontal line connects the label \"man\" to the label \"rational.\"\n*   There are no branching lines or unconnected lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   In both the top and bottom groupings, the horizontal line originates near \"man\" (inside the outer curve) and crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve to reach the second label (\"animal\" or \"rational\").\n\n**NESTING**\n*   In both the top and bottom groupings, the smaller closed curve (containing \"animal\" or \"rational\") is nested entirely within the larger outer closed curve (which also contains \"man\").",
