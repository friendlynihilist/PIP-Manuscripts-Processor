  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided diagram, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Top Large Curve:** Contains the text labels \"fears\" and \"snake\".\n*   **Top Small Curve:** Contains only the text label \"fears\".\n*   **Bottom Large Curve:** Contains the text labels \"hates\" and \"snake\".\n*   **Bottom Small Curve:** Contains only the text label \"hates\".\n*   **Outside all curves:** The text label \"man\" is located to the left of all closed curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   The label \"man\" is connected to a single line that branches into two paths.\n*   One branch connects \"man\" to the label \"fears\".\n*   The other branch connects \"man\" to the label \"hates\".\n*   A separate line connects \"fears\" to \"snake\" (top).\n*   A separate line connects \"hates\" to \"snake\" (bottom).\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The line branching from \"man\" to \"fears\" crosses the boundaries of both the top large curve and the top small curve.\n*   The line branching from \"man\" to \"hates\" crosses the boundaries of both the bottom large curve and the bottom small curve.\n*   The line connecting \"fears\" to \"snake\" (top) crosses the boundary of the top small curve but remains inside the top large curve.\n*   The line connecting \"hates\" to \"snake\" (bottom) crosses the boundary of the bottom small curve but remains inside the bottom large curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The top small curve is nested inside the top large curve.\n*   The bottom small curve is nested inside the bottom large curve.",
