  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside the innermost closed curve:** The text labels \"fears\" and \"hates\" are contained within the smallest central boundary.\n*   **Inside the middle closed curve:** The labels \"fears\" and \"hates\" are also inside this curve.\n*   **Inside the outermost closed curve:** The labels \"fears\", \"hates\", and \"snake\" are contained within the largest boundary.\n*   **Outside all closed curves:** The text label \"man\" is located outside all three closed curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A thick horizontal line segment connects the label \"man\" to the left side of a large parenthesis-like shape.\n*   A thick horizontal line segment connects the right side of a large parenthesis-like shape to the label \"snake\".\n*   There are no branching lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The line segment on the left crosses the boundaries of all three nested closed curves to reach the internal parenthesis-like shape.\n*   The line segment on the right crosses the boundaries of the innermost and middle closed curves to connect the internal parenthesis-like shape to the label \"snake\".\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There are three nested closed curves.\n*   The innermost curve is entirely contained within a middle curve.\n*   The middle curve is entirely contained within a larger, outermost curve that extends further to the right.",
