  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outer closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"man\", \"rational\", and \"animal\".\n*   **Inner closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"rational\" and \"animal\".\n*   **Outside both curves:** No text labels are located outside the boundaries of the outer curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A single horizontal line connects the text label \"man\" to a large, bold \"C\" shape.\n*   The \"C\" shape branches into two text labels: \"rational\" (positioned above) and \"animal\" (positioned below).\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line originating from \"man\" crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve to connect with the \"C\" shape.\n*   The \"C\" shape itself is positioned such that its left edge is near the boundary of the inner curve, while its branches extend further into the interior of that curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is one inner closed curve nested entirely within a larger outer closed curve.",
