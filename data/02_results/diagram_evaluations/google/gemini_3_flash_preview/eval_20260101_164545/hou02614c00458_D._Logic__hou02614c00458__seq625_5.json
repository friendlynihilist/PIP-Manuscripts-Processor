  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inner closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"rational\" and \"animal\".\n*   **Outer closed curve:** Contains the text label \"man\", as well as the entire inner closed curve and its contents (\"rational\" and \"animal\").\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line segment connects the text label \"man\" to a large, bold, C-shaped bracket.\n*   The C-shaped bracket is positioned to the left of the labels \"rational\" and \"animal\", appearing to group them together.\n*   There are no other lines or branching connections.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line segment originating from \"man\" crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve to connect with the C-shaped bracket inside.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The inner closed curve is entirely nested within the outer closed curve.",
