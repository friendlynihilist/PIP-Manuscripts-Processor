  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outer Curve:** Contains the text labels \"man\", \"rational\", and \"animal\".\n*   **Inner Curve:** Contains the text labels \"rational\" and \"animal\". The label \"man\" is outside this curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line originates from the right side of the word \"man\".\n*   This line branches into a vertical bracket shape (resembling a brace or a large \"C\").\n*   The top of this bracket is positioned to the left of the word \"rational\".\n*   The bottom of this bracket is positioned to the left of the word \"animal\".\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line originating from \"man\" crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve before it branches into the bracket.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There are two closed curves. The smaller curve is nested entirely within the larger, outer curve.",
