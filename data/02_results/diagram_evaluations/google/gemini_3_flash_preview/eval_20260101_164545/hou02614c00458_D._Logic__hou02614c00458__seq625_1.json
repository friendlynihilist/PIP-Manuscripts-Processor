  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided diagram, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside the innermost curves:** The words \"fears\" and \"hates\" are contained within small, bracket-like closed curves. This occurs twice: once in the top grouping and once in the bottom grouping.\n*   **Inside the middle curves:** The words \"fears\" and \"hates\" (and their surrounding brackets) are contained within a larger oval-shaped curve. This occurs in both the top and bottom groupings.\n*   **Inside the outermost curves:** The words \"fears,\" \"hates,\" and \"snake\" are all contained within the largest, outermost oval-shaped curves. This occurs in both the top and bottom groupings.\n*   **Outside all curves:** The word \"man\" is located to the left, outside of all closed curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   **Branching lines:** A single line originates from the word \"man\" and branches into two curved lines (forming a bracket shape).\n*   **Connections to curves:** The two branches from \"man\" connect to the left side of the innermost curves surrounding \"fears\" and \"hates.\"\n*   **Connections to labels:** Short horizontal lines connect the right side of the innermost curves to the word \"snake\" in both the top and bottom groupings.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The lines originating from \"man\" cross the boundaries of both the outermost and middle closed curves to reach the innermost curves.\n*   The lines connecting to \"snake\" cross the boundary of the middle closed curve but remain inside the outermost closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There are two identical sets of nested curves (one top, one bottom).\n*   In each set, the innermost curve (containing \"fears\" and \"hates\") is nested inside a middle curve.\n*   The middle curve is nested inside a larger, outermost curve.",
