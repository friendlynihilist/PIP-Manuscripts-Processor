  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Outer closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"catholic\", \"adores\", and \"woman\".\n*   **Inner closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"adores\" and \"woman\". The label \"catholic\" is outside this inner curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line connects the label \"catholic\" to the label \"adores\".\n*   A horizontal line connects the label \"adores\" to the label \"woman\".\n*   There is a thick, dark, angled line segment in the top right corner that is not connected to any text labels.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line connecting \"catholic\" and \"adores\" crosses the left boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   The thick, dark line segment in the top right crosses the boundaries of both the inner and outer closed curves.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The inner closed curve is nested entirely within the outer closed curve.",
