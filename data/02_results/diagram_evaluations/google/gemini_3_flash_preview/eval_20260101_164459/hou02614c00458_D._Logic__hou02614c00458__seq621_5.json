  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inner closed curve:** Contains the text label \"adores\".\n*   **Outer closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"Catholic\" and \"adores\".\n*   **Outside all curves:** The text label \"woman\" is located outside both closed curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line connects \"Catholic\" to \"adores\".\n*   A horizontal line connects \"adores\" to \"woman\".\n*   There are no branching lines; the connections form a single linear path from left to right.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The line connecting \"Catholic\" and \"adores\" crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   The line connecting \"adores\" and \"woman\" crosses the boundaries of both the inner and outer closed curves.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The inner closed curve (surrounding \"adores\") is nested entirely within the outer closed curve (surrounding \"Catholic\" and \"adores\").",
