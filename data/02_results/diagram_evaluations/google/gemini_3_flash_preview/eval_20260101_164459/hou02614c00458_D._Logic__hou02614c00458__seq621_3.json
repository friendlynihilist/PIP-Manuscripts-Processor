  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the spatial layout of the diagram:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside the closed curve:** The text label \"wounded\" and the lower instance of the text label \"man\" are contained within the boundary.\n*   **Outside the closed curve:** The upper instance of the text label \"man\" is located outside the boundary to the left.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line connects the upper \"man\" to the word \"wounded.\"\n*   A vertical line branches downward from the middle of that horizontal line and connects to the lower \"man.\"\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The horizontal line connecting the upper \"man\" to \"wounded\" crosses the boundary of the closed curve.\n*   The vertical line connecting to the lower \"man\" is entirely contained within the boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is only one closed curve; therefore, there is no nesting of curves.",
