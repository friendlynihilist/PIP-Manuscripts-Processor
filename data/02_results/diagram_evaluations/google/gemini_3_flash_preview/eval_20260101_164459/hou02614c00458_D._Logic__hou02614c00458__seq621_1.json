  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a spatial description of the diagram:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inner closed curve:** Contains the text labels \"adores\" and \"woman\" (the version of \"woman\" with a large initial 'T' or 'L' shape).\n*   **Outer closed curve:** Contains the text label \"Catholic\" as well as everything inside the inner closed curve (\"adores\" and \"woman\").\n*   **Outside both curves:** A third instance of the word \"woman\" is located to the far right, outside both closed boundaries.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A horizontal line connects the label \"Catholic\" to the label \"adores\".\n*   A second horizontal line connects the label \"adores\" to the label \"woman\" located inside the inner curve.\n*   A third horizontal line extends from the \"woman\" inside the inner curve to the \"woman\" outside the curves.\n*   There are no branching lines; the connections form a single linear path from left to right.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The line connecting \"Catholic\" to \"adores\" crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   The line connecting the inner \"woman\" to the outer \"woman\" crosses the boundaries of both the inner and outer closed curves.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   The inner closed curve is entirely nested within the outer closed curve.",
