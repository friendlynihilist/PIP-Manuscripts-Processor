  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the provided image, here is a description of the spatial relationships:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside the closed curve:** The text labels \"man\" (bottom instance) and \"wounded\" are located inside the elongated closed curve.\n*   **Outside the closed curve:** The text label \"man\" (top instance) is located outside and above the closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   **Horizontal Line 1:** A short horizontal line segment extends to the right of the top \"man\" label.\n*   **Horizontal Line 2:** A horizontal line segment is positioned between the bottom \"man\" and \"wounded\" labels.\n*   **Vertical Line:** A vertical line segment intersects the horizontal line between the bottom labels. It extends upward, terminating near the horizontal line segment attached to the top \"man\" label.\n*   **Branching:** The lines form a \"T\" shape where the vertical line meets the bottom horizontal line.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The vertical line crosses the top boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is only one closed curve; therefore, there is no nesting of curves.",
