  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "Based on the spatial relationships in the diagram:\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n*   **Inside the closed curve:** The word \"wounded\" and the lower instance of the word \"man\" are located within the boundary of the closed curve.\n*   **Outside the closed curve:** The upper instance of the word \"man\" is located outside the boundary.\n\n**CONNECTIONS**\n*   A vertical, slightly curved line connects the upper \"man\" to the lower \"man.\"\n*   There is a short horizontal stroke extending from the vertical line toward the word \"wounded,\" though it does not physically touch the letters of that word.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**\n*   The vertical line connecting the two instances of \"man\" crosses the upper boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING**\n*   There is only one closed curve; therefore, there is no nesting of curves.",
