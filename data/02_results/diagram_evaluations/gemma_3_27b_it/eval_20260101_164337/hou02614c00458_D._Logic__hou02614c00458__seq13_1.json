  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Inside the closed curve:** The text labels \"man\", a vertical line, and \"wounded\" are located within the closed curve.\n*   **Outside the closed curve:** The text label \"mant\" is located outside the closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   The text label \"man\" is connected to the vertical line.\n*   The vertical line is connected to the text label \"wounded\".\n*   There is no branching.\n*   There are no unconnected lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The vertical line crosses the boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   There are no nested closed curves. There is only one closed curve.",
