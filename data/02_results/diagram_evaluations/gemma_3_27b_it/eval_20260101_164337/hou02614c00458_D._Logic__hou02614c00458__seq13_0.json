  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   The text labels \"many\" and \"wounded\" are inside the larger closed curve.\n*   The text label \"man\" is partially inside and partially outside the larger closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   A line connects the text label \"many\" to the text label \"wounded\".\n*   A line connects the text label \"man\" to the line connecting \"many\" and \"wounded\". This creates a branching point.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"man\" to the other line crosses the boundary of the larger closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   There are no nested closed curves. There is only one closed curve in the diagram.",
