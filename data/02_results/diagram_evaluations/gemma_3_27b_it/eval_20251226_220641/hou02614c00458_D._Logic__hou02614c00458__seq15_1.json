  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "**1. Words:**\n\n*   \"disgrace\"\n*   \"wounded\"\n*   \"man\"\n\n**2. Lines:**\n\n*   A line connecting \"man\" to the shape containing \"disgrace\" and \"wounded\".\n*   The lines forming the letters within the words.\n\n**3. Shapes:**\n\n*   An irregular, rounded shape (almost like a speech bubble or a cloud) enclosing the words \"disgrace\" and \"wounded\".\n\n**4. Arcs:**\n\n*   The curved lines forming the shape around \"disgrace\" and \"wounded\".\n\n**5. Nodes/Points:**\n\n*   The points where the line connecting \"man\" intersects with the shape.\n\n**In summary:** The image contains 3 words, several lines (including a connecting line), a rounded shape, arcs forming the shape, and nodes where the line intersects the shape.",
