  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   The text \"catholic\" \"adores\" \"woman\" is entirely contained within a single, closed, elongated curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   The words \"catholic\", \"adores\", and \"woman\" are connected by lines.\n*   The line connecting \"catholic\" and \"adores\" branches into a second line connecting \"adores\" and \"woman\".\n*   There is an unconnected line extending from the right side of the closed curve.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The unconnected line extends *outside* the boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   There are no nested closed curves. There is only one closed curve in the diagram.",
