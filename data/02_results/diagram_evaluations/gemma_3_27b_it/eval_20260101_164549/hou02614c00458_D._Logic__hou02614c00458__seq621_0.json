  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   The text labels \"man\", \"wounded\", and the connecting line are all located *inside* a single closed, irregular curve.\n*   The comma is located *outside* the closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   The text label \"man\" is connected to the text label \"wounded\" by a single line.\n*   The line is straight.\n*   There is no branching.\n*   There are no unconnected lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   No lines cross the boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   There are no nested closed curves. There is only one closed curve present.",
