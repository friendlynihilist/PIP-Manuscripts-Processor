  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Inside the closed curve:** The text labels \"man\" and \"wounded\" are located inside the closed curve.\n*   **Outside the closed curve:** The text label \"man\" is located outside the closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   The text label \"man\" (outside the curve) is connected to the text label \"man\" (inside the curve) by a vertical line.\n*   The text label \"man\" (inside the curve) is connected to the text label \"wounded\" (inside the curve) by a horizontal line.\n*   There is a vertical line extending upwards from the connection point of the two lines, but it does not connect to any other text label.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The vertical line connecting the two \"man\" labels crosses the boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   There are no nested closed curves. There is only one closed curve in the diagram.",
