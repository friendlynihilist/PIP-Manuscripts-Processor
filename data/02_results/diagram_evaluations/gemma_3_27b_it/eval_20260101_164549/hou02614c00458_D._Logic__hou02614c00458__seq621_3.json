  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Outer Curve:** The text labels \"man\" and \"wounded\" are *inside* the larger, elongated closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text label \"man\" is *inside* the smaller, lower closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   The text label \"man\" (upper) is connected to the text label \"wounded\" by a single line.\n*   The text label \"man\" (lower) is connected to the line connecting \"man\" and \"wounded\" by a single line.\n*   The line connecting \"man\" and \"wounded\" branches into two lines at the point where it connects to the lower \"man\".\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"man\" and \"wounded\" crosses the boundary of the outer closed curve.\n*   The line connecting the lower \"man\" to the line connecting \"man\" and \"wounded\" crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   No closed curves are fully nested inside others. The curves overlap, but neither is entirely contained within the other.",
