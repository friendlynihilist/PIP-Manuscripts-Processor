  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Outer Curve:** Contains the text labels \"Catholic\", \"adores\", and \"woman\".\n*   **Inner Curve:** Contains the text label \"adores\".\n*   The text label \"woman\" is outside both curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   A line connects \"Catholic\" to \"adores\".\n*   A line connects \"adores\" to \"woman\" (the label outside the curves).\n*   There is a second instance of the text label \"woman\" inside the outer curve, but it is not connected to any other labels by a line.\n*   There are no branching lines.\n*   There are no unconnected lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"adores\" to \"woman\" crosses the boundary of the outer curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   The inner curve is nested inside the outer curve.",
