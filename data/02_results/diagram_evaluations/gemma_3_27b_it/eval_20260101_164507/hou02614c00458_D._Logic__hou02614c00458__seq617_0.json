  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Outer Curve:** The text labels \"man\" and \"American\" are outside the outer closed curve. The text label \"respects\" is inside the outer closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text label \"respects\" is inside the inner closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   A line connects the text label \"man\" to the inner closed curve.\n*   A line connects the text label \"American\" to the inner closed curve.\n*   The lines branching from \"man\" and \"American\" connect to the same point on the inner closed curve.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"man\" crosses the boundary of the outer closed curve.\n*   The line connecting \"American\" crosses the boundary of the outer closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   The inner closed curve is nested inside the outer closed curve.",
