  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   The text label \"wounds\" is entirely inside the closed curve.\n*   The text label \"man\" is entirely outside the closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   The text labels \"man\" and \"wounds\" are connected by a line.\n*   The line appears to originate from the right side of \"man\" and terminates at the left side of \"wounds\".\n*   There are no branching lines.\n*   There are no unconnected lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"man\" and \"wounds\" crosses the boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   There are no nested closed curves. There is only one closed curve in the diagram.",
