  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   The text label \"is rounded\" is located entirely within the larger, elongated closed curve.\n*   The arrow shape is partially inside the larger closed curve, with the arrowhead extending outside.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   The arrow shape is connected to the text label \"is rounded\" by a line.\n*   The line originating from the arrow shape does not connect to any other text label.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line originating from the arrow shape crosses the boundary of the larger closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   There are no nested closed curves. There is only one closed curve.",
