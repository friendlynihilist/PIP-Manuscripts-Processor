  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Top Closed Curve:** Contains the text labels \"fears\", \"snake\", and \"chates\".\n*   **Bottom Closed Curve:** Contains the text labels \"bears\", \"snake\", and \"hates\".\n*   **Outside all Closed Curves:** The text label \"man\" is located outside of both closed curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   \"man\" is connected by a line to the top closed curve.\n*   The top closed curve is connected by a line to the text label \"snake\".\n*   The bottom closed curve is connected by a line to the text label \"snake\".\n*   There is a branching line originating from \"man\" that connects to both closed curves.\n*   The line connecting the top closed curve to \"snake\" and the bottom closed curve to \"snake\" do not connect to each other.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"man\" to the top closed curve crosses the boundary of the top closed curve.\n*   The line connecting \"man\" to the bottom closed curve crosses the boundary of the bottom closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   No closed curves are nested inside others. They are positioned side-by-side.",
