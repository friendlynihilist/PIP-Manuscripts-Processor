  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Outer Curve:** The text labels \"man\" and \"animal\" are outside the outer closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text label \"rotational\" is inside the inner closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text label \"animal\" is partially inside the inner closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   \"rotational\" and \"animal\" are connected by a line.\n*   \"man\" and \"rotational\" are connected by a line.\n*   The line connecting \"man\" and \"rotational\" branches off to connect to \"animal\".\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"man\" and \"rotational\" crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve.\n*   The text label \"animal\" crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   The inner closed curve is nested inside the outer closed curve.",
