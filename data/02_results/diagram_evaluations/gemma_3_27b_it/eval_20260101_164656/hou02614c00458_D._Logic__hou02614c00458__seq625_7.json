  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   The text label \"werunder\" is entirely contained within a single closed, oval-like curve.\n*   A short line segment extending to the left of \"werunder\" is partially outside the curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   The short line segment is connected to the leftmost part of the text label \"werunder\".\n*   There is a curved line extending from the right side of \"werunder\" that does not connect to any other label. It terminates without connection.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The curved line extending from the right side of \"werunder\" crosses the boundary of the oval-like curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   There are no nested closed curves. There is only one closed curve in the diagram.",
