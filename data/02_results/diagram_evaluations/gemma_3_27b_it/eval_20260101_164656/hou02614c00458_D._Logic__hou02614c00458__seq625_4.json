  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Outer Curve:** The text labels \"man\", \"Snake\", and \"hates\" are outside the outer closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text label \"fears\" is inside the inner closed curve. The text label \"hates\" is partially inside and partially outside the inner closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   \"man\" is connected to the inner curve by a line.\n*   The inner curve is connected to \"Snake\" by a line.\n*   \"hates\" is connected to both the inner curve and \"Snake\" by lines.\n*   There is a branching line originating from the inner curve, connecting to both \"hates\" and \"Snake\".\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"hates\" to the inner curve crosses the boundary of the inner closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   The inner closed curve is nested inside the outer closed curve.",
