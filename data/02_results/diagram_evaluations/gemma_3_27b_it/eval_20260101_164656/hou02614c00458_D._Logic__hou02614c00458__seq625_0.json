  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Top Curve:** The text \"man\" and \"animal\" are inside the top closed curve.\n*   **Bottom Curve:** The text \"man\" and \"rational\" are inside the bottom closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   \"man\" (top) is connected to \"animal\" (top) by a line.\n*   \"man\" (bottom) is connected to \"rational\" (bottom) by a line.\n*   There are no branching lines.\n*   There are no unconnected lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"man\" and \"animal\" crosses the boundary of the top closed curve.\n*   The line connecting \"man\" and \"rational\" crosses the boundary of the bottom closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   There is no nesting of closed curves. The two curves are positioned one above the other, but do not overlap or contain each other.",
