  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Outer Curve:** The text labels \"man\" and a portion of the line connecting to \"rational\" are outside the outer closed curve. The text label \"rational animal\" is inside the outer closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text label \"rational animal\" is inside the inner closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   The text label \"man\" is connected to the inner closed curve by a line.\n*   The text label \"rational animal\" is connected to the line extending from \"man\".\n*   The line extending from \"man\" does not branch.\n*   There are no unconnected lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"man\" to the inner curve crosses the boundary of the outer curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   The inner closed curve is nested inside the outer closed curve.",
