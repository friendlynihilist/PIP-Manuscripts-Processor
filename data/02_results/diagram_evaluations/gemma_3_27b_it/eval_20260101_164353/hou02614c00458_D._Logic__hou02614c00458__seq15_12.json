  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Outer Curve:** The text label \"wounded\" is entirely contained within the outer closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text label \"man\" is entirely contained within the inner closed curve.\n*   **Outside Curves:** The text label \"man\" and \"wounded\" are both outside of the outer closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   The text label \"man\" is connected to the text label \"wounded\" by a line.\n*   The line connecting \"man\" and \"wounded\" branches into a curved line that touches the outer closed curve.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"man\" and \"wounded\" crosses the boundary of the outer closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   The inner closed curve appears to be nested within the outer closed curve.",
