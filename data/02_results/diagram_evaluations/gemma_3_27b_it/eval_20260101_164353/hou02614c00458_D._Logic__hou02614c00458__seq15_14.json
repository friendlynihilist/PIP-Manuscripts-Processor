  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",

The text \"man\" is partially inside and partially outside the top curve.\n*   **Bottom Curve (Outer):** The text \"disgracer\" is inside the outer bottom closed curve. The text \"mort\" is partially inside and partially outside the outer bottom curve.\n*   **Bottom Curve (Inner):** The text \"mant\" is inside the inner bottom closed curve.\n*   **Lowest Text:** The text \"man\" and \"wormded\" are outside all closed curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   \"man\" (top) is connected to \"wounded\" by a line.\n*   \"mant\" (bottom inner) is connected to \"disgracer\" by a line.\n*   \"mort\" (bottom outer) is connected to \"wormded\" (lowest) by a line.\n*   There is a branching line originating from \"man\" (top) that connects to \"mant\" (bottom inner).\n*   There is a branching line originating from \"mort\" (bottom outer) that connects to \"man\" (lowest).\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   A line crosses the boundary of the top closed curve, connecting \"man\" to \"wounded\".\n*   A line crosses the boundary of the outer bottom closed curve, connecting \"mort\" to \"wormded\".\n*   A line crosses the boundary of the inner bottom closed curve, connecting \"mant\" to \"disgracer\".\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   The inner bottom closed curve is nested inside the outer bottom closed curve.\n*   The top closed curve and the outer bottom closed curve overlap.",
