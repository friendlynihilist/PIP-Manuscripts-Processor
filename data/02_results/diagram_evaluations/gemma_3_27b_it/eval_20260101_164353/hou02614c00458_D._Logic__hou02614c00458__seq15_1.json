  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Outer Curve:** The text labels \"man\" and \"wounded\" are outside the outer closed curve. The text label \"disgrace\" is inside the outer closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text label \"disgrace\" is inside the inner closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   \"man\" is connected to the outer closed curve by a line.\n*   \"wounded\" is connected to the outer closed curve by a line.\n*   \"disgrace\" is connected to the inner closed curve by a line.\n*   The inner and outer closed curves are connected by a line.\n*   There is a branching line originating from the outer closed curve, connecting to \"disgrace\".\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting the inner and outer closed curves crosses the boundary of both curves.\n*   The branching line from the outer curve crosses the boundary of the outer curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   The inner closed curve is nested inside the outer closed curve.",
