  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Outer Curve:** The text labels \"man\", \"disgraced\", and \"wounded\" are all located inside the larger, outer closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text label \"man\" and a portion of the line connecting to \"disgraced\" are inside the smaller, inner closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   \"man\" is connected to \"disgraced\" by a line.\n*   \"man\" is also connected to \"wounded\" by a line that branches from the line connecting to \"disgraced\".\n*   There is an unconnected line extending from the left side of the outer curve.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   The line connecting \"man\" to \"disgraced\" crosses the boundary of the outer curve.\n*   The line connecting \"man\" to \"wounded\" crosses the boundary of the outer curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   The smaller, inner closed curve is nested inside the larger, outer closed curve.",
