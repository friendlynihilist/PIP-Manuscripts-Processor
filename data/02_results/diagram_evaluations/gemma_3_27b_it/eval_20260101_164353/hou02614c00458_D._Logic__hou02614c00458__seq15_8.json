  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "**CONTAINMENT:**\n\n*   **Outer Curve:** The text labels \"mounded\" and a portion of the line connecting to \"man\" are inside the outer closed curve.\n*   **Inner Curve:** The text label \"mont disgraceer\" is inside the inner closed curve.\n*   **Outside all Curves:** The text label \"man\" is outside both closed curves.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n\n*   \"man\" is connected by a line to the outer curve.\n*   The line originating from \"man\" branches into two lines that connect to \"mounded\".\n*   The inner curve is connected to the outer curve by a line.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n\n*   A line crosses the boundary of the inner curve, connecting it to the outer curve.\n*   A line crosses the boundary of the outer curve, connecting to \"man\".\n\n**NESTING:**\n\n*   The inner closed curve is nested inside the outer closed curve.",
