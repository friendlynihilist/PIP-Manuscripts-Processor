  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The text labels \"fears\" and \"hates\" are inside both closed curves.\n- The text label \"snake\" is outside both closed curves.\n- The text label \"man\" is outside both closed curves.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects the text label \"man\" to the left side of the top closed curve.\n- Another line connects the right side of the top closed curve to the text label \"snake.\"\n- A separate line connects the text label \"man\" to the left side of the bottom closed curve.\n- Another line connects the right side of the bottom closed curve to the text label \"snake.\"\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" to the top closed curve crosses the boundary of the top closed curve.\n- The line connecting the top closed curve to \"snake\" crosses the boundary of the top closed curve.\n- The line connecting \"man\" to the bottom closed curve crosses the boundary of the bottom closed curve.\n- The line connecting the bottom closed curve to \"snake\" crosses the boundary of the bottom closed curve.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no closed curves nested inside others. Both closed curves are separate and do not overlap.",
