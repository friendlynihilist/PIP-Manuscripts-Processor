  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The label \"man\" is inside the left closed curve.\n- The labels \"rational\" and \"animal\" are inside the right closed curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects the two closed curves. There is no branching, and there are no unconnected lines.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The connecting line crosses the boundary of both closed curves.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no closed curves nested inside others. Both closed curves are separate and do not contain other closed curves within them.",
