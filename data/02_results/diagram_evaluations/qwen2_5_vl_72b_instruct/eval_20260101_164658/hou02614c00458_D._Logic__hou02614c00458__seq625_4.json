  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The text labels \"tears\" and \"hates\" are inside the closed curve.\n- The text labels \"man\" and \"snake\" are outside the closed curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects the text label \"man\" to the closed curve.\n- Another line connects the closed curve to the text label \"snake.\"\n- There are no branching lines, and all lines are connected to either the closed curve or the text labels.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" to the closed curve crosses the boundary of the closed curve.\n- The line connecting the closed curve to \"snake\" does not cross the boundary of the closed curve but extends from it.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no closed curves nested inside other closed curves. The single closed curve is not contained within another.",
