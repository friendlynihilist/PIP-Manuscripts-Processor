  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The text \"fears\" is inside the top closed curve.\n- The text \"hates\" is inside the bottom closed curve.\n- The text \"man,\" \"snake,\" and \"snake\" are outside the closed curves.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects \"man\" to the top closed curve containing \"fears.\"\n- Another line connects the top closed curve containing \"fears\" to the word \"snake.\"\n- A line connects the bottom closed curve containing \"hates\" to the word \"snake.\"\n- There is no branching, and all lines are connected to at least one other element.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" to the top closed curve crosses the boundary of the top closed curve.\n- The line connecting the top closed curve to \"snake\" does not cross any closed curve boundary.\n- The line connecting the bottom closed curve to \"snake\" does not cross any closed curve boundary.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no closed curves nested inside others. Both closed curves are separate and do not overlap.",
