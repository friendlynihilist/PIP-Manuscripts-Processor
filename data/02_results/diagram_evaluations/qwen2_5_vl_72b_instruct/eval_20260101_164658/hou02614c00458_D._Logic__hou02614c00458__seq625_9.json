  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "This diagram consists of a single closed curve and some text labels, along with a line:\n\n- **CONTAINMENT**: The word \"wounded\" is inside the closed curve. There are no other text labels present in the diagram.\n\n- **CONNECTIONS**: A line extends from the left side of the closed curve and continues outside it. This line does not connect to any other elements within the diagram. There are no branching lines.\n\n- **BOUNDARY CROSSINGS**: The line crosses the boundary of the closed curve at one point on the left side.\n\n- **NESTING**: There are no nested closed curves in this diagram; only one closed curve is present.",
