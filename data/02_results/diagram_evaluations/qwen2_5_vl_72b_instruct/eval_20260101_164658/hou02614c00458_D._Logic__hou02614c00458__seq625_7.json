  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The text label \"wonder\" is inside the closed oval curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line extends from the left side of the oval, connecting to it at one point. There are no other connections visible, and no branching or unconnected lines are present.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line crosses the boundary of the closed oval curve at one point where it connects to the oval.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no nested closed curves; only one closed curve (the oval) is present.",
