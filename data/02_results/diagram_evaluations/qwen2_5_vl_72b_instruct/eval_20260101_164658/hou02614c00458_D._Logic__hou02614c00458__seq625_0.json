  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- In the top closed curve, \"animal\" is inside the curve, and \"man\" is outside.\n- In the bottom closed curve, \"rational\" is inside the curve, and \"man\" is outside.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects \"man\" to \"animal.\"\n- Another line connects \"man\" to \"rational.\"\n- There are no branching lines, and all lines connect directly from \"man\" to either \"animal\" or \"rational.\"\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" to \"animal\" crosses the boundary of the top closed curve.\n- The line connecting \"man\" to \"rational\" crosses the boundary of the bottom closed curve.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no closed curves nested inside others. Each closed curve is separate and does not contain another closed curve within it.",
