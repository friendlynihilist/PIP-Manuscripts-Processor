  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The text label \"man\" is inside the larger closed curve on the left side.\n- The text label \"rational animal\" is inside the smaller closed curve on the right side.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects the text label \"man\" to the text label \"rational animal.\"\n- There are no branching lines, and there are no unconnected lines.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" and \"rational animal\" crosses the boundary of the larger closed curve that contains \"man.\"\n\n### NESTING:\n- The smaller closed curve containing \"rational animal\" is nested inside the larger closed curve containing \"man.\"",
