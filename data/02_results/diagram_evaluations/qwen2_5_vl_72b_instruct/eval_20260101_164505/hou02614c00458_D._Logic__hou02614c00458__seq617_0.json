  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The word \"respects\" is inside a closed oval shape.\n- The words \"man\" and \"American\" are outside the closed oval shape.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- The word \"respects\" is connected to the word \"man\" by a line that branches out from the bottom left of the oval.\n- The word \"respects\" is also connected to the word \"American\" by a line that branches out from the bottom right of the oval.\n- There are no unconnected lines.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The lines connecting \"respects\" to \"man\" and \"American\" cross the boundary of the closed oval shape.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no closed curves nested inside other closed curves. The oval containing \"respects\" is not nested within another closed curve.",
