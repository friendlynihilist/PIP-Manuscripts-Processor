  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The word \"man\" is inside the leftmost closed curve.\n- The word \"respects\" is inside the middle closed curve.\n- The word \"American\" is inside the rightmost closed curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects the word \"man\" to the word \"respects.\"\n- Another line connects the word \"respects\" to the word \"American.\"\n- There are no branching lines, and all lines are connected.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" to \"respects\" crosses the boundary of the leftmost closed curve.\n- The line connecting \"respects\" to \"American\" crosses the boundary of the middle closed curve.\n\n### NESTING:\n- The middle closed curve containing \"respects\" is nested inside the larger closed curve that encompasses all three words (\"man,\" \"respects,\" and \"American\").\n- The leftmost and rightmost closed curves are not nested within each other but are part of the larger encompassing curve.",
