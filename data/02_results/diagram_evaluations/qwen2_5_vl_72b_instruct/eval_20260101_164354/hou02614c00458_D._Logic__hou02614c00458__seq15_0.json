  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The text \"man disgraced\" is inside the large closed curve.\n- The text \"man\" and \"wounded\" are outside the large closed curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- The text \"man\" is connected to the large closed curve by a line that branches into two paths.\n- One branch of the line connects to the text \"man disgraced\" inside the large closed curve.\n- The other branch of the line connects to the text \"wounded\" outside the large closed curve.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" to \"man disgraced\" crosses the boundary of the large closed curve.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no closed curves nested inside other closed curves. The large closed curve contains only the text \"man disgraced\" and does not enclose any other closed curves.",
