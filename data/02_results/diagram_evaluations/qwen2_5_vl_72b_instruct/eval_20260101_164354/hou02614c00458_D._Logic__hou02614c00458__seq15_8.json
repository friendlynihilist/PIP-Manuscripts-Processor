  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The word \"many\" is inside a small oval shape.\n- The words \"disgraces\" and \"wounded\" are outside the small oval but inside a larger, irregular closed curve that encompasses the oval and these two words.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects the word \"many\" (inside the small oval) to the word \"wounded\" (outside the small oval).\n- There is no branching on this line; it is a single continuous line connecting these two words.\n- The word \"disgraces\" is not directly connected by a line to any other text label.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"many\" and \"wounded\" crosses the boundary of the small oval containing \"many.\"\n\n### NESTING:\n- The small oval containing \"many\" is nested inside the larger irregular closed curve that also contains \"disgraces\" and \"wounded.\"",
