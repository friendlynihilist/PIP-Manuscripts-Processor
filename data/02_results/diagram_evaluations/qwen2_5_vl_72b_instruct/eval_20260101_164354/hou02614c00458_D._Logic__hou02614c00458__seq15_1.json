  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The text label \"disgraces\" is inside the top part of the closed curve.\n- The text label \"wounded\" is inside the bottom part of the closed curve.\n- The text label \"man\" is outside the closed curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects the text label \"man\" to the closed curve, entering it near the middle section.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" crosses the boundary of the closed curve at one point.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no nested closed curves; the single closed curve does not contain any other closed curves within it.",
