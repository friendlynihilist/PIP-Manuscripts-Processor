  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "This image contains handwritten text and a single line connecting two words. Here's the spatial description:\n\n**CONTAINMENT:** There are no closed curves in this diagram, so there are no text labels inside or outside any closed shapes.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:** The word \"man\" is connected to the word \"wounded\" by a single line. There are no branching or unconnected lines.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:** Since there are no closed curves, there are no boundary crossings.\n\n**NESTING:** There are no closed curves, so there is no nesting.",
