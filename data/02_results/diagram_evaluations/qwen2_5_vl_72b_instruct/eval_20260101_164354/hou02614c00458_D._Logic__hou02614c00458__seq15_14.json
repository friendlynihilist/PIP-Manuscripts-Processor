  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The word \"wounded\" is inside the topmost closed curve.\n- The words \"man\" and \"disgraces\" are inside the middle closed curve.\n- The word \"man\" is inside the bottom closed curve, which also contains the word \"wounded.\"\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects the word \"man\" (outside the curves) to the word \"wounded\" inside the topmost closed curve.\n- Another line connects the word \"man\" (outside the curves) to the word \"man\" inside the bottom closed curve.\n- There is no branching observed in the lines, and there are no unconnected lines.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" (outside the curves) to \"wounded\" crosses the boundary of the topmost closed curve.\n- The line connecting \"man\" (outside the curves) to \"man\" crosses the boundary of the bottom closed curve.\n\n### NESTING:\n- The middle closed curve is nested inside the bottom closed curve.",
