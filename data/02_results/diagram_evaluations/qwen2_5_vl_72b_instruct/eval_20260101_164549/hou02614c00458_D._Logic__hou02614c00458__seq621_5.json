  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The word \"Catholic\" is partially inside and partially outside the closed curve.\n- The word \"adore\" is entirely inside the closed curve.\n- The word \"woman\" is entirely outside the closed curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- There is a line connecting the end of \"Catholic\" to the beginning of \"adore.\"\n- Another line connects the end of \"adore\" to the beginning of \"woman.\"\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"Catholic\" to \"adore\" crosses the boundary of the closed curve.\n- The line connecting \"adore\" to \"woman\" does not cross the boundary of the closed curve.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There is one closed curve, and it is not nested inside another closed curve.",
