  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "This image contains handwritten text within a single, elongated, closed curve that resembles an oval or capsule shape. Here's the spatial description:\n\n**CONTAINMENT:**\n- The text \"man - wounded,\" is entirely inside the closed curve.\n\n**CONNECTIONS:**\n- There are no lines connecting any text labels or other elements in the diagram.\n\n**BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:**\n- No lines cross the boundary of the closed curve.\n\n**NESTING:**\n- There are no nested closed curves; only one closed curve is present.",
