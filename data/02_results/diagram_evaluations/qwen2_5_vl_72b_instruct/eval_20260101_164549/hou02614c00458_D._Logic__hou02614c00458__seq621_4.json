  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The text label \"man\" is inside the closed curve.\n- The text label \"wounded\" is outside the closed curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- The text label \"man\" is connected to the text label \"wounded\" by a line that extends from the word \"man\" and points towards \"wounded.\"\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" to \"wounded\" crosses the boundary of the closed curve.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no closed curves nested inside others. The closed curve contains only the text label \"man.\"",
