  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The word \"wounded\" is inside the closed curve.\n- The words \"man\" and \"man\" are outside the closed curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- The word \"man\" on the left is connected to the word \"wounded\" by a line that forms part of the closed curve.\n- The word \"man\" on the right is connected to the word \"wounded\" by a line that also forms part of the closed curve.\n- There are no branching or unconnected lines.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- No lines cross the boundaries of the closed curve; the lines form the boundary itself.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no closed curves nested inside others. The single closed curve contains only the word \"wounded.\"",
