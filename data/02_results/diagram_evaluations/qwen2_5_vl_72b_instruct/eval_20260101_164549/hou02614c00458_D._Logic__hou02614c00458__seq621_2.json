  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The text \"catholic\" is inside the larger closed curve.\n- The text \"adored-woman\" is inside a smaller closed curve that is also within the larger closed curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- There is a line connecting the word \"catholic\" to the smaller closed curve containing \"adored-woman.\"\n- No other connections are present, and there are no branching or unconnected lines.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"catholic\" to the smaller closed curve crosses the boundary of the larger closed curve.\n\n### NESTING:\n- The smaller closed curve containing \"adored-woman\" is nested inside the larger closed curve.",
