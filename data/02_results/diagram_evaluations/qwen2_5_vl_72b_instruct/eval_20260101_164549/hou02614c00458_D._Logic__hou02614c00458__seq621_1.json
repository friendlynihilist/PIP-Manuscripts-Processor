  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The label \"Catholic\" is inside the leftmost closed curve.\n- The label \"advice\" is inside the middle closed curve.\n- The label \"woman\" is partially inside and partially outside the rightmost closed curve, with the majority of the word inside.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects the label \"Catholic\" to the label \"advice.\"\n- Another line connects the label \"advice\" to the label \"woman.\"\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"Catholic\" to \"advice\" crosses the boundary of the leftmost closed curve.\n- The line connecting \"advice\" to \"woman\" crosses the boundary of the middle closed curve.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no closed curves nested inside others. Each closed curve is separate from the others.",
