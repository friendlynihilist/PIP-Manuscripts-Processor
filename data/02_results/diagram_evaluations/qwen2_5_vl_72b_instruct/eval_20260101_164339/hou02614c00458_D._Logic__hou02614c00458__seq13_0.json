  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "### CONTAINMENT:\n- The text labels \"many,\" \"man,\" and \"wounded\" are all inside the single closed curve.\n\n### CONNECTIONS:\n- There is a line connecting the text label \"man\" to the text label \"wounded.\"\n- No other connections are present between the text labels.\n\n### BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line connecting \"man\" to \"wounded\" does not cross the boundary of the closed curve.\n\n### NESTING:\n- There are no nested closed curves; only one closed curve is present.",
