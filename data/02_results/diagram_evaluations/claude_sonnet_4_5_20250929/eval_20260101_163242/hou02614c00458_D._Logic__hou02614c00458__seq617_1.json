  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- The text \"man -respects- American\" is contained within a single elongated oval/rounded rectangle shape\n- The word \"respects\" appears to have strikethrough marks through it\n- All three text elements (man, respects, American) are inside the same closed curve\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- There are horizontal lines connecting the text elements\n- A line connects \"man\" to \"respects\" (with \"respects\" crossed out)\n- A line connects \"respects\" to \"American\"\n- These form a linear sequence from left to right: man → respects → American\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- There is a small line or mark that appears to extend upward from the top of the oval, crossing the boundary of the closed curve near the center-top area\n\n## NESTING:\n- There is only one main closed curve (the large oval)\n- No closed curves are nested inside others\n- The diagram consists of a single-level containment structure",
