  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- The text \"Grounded\" is inside a closed oval/elliptical curve\n- The text \"man\" is outside the closed curve, positioned to the left of it\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- A horizontal line connects the text \"man\" to the oval boundary\n- The line extends from the right side of \"man\" and terminates at the left edge of the oval\n- There is no branching observed\n- The text \"Grounded\" inside the oval is not connected by any lines\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The horizontal line from \"man\" meets the oval boundary but does not cross through it\n- The line terminates at the boundary edge\n\n## NESTING:\n- There is only one closed curve (the oval)\n- No nested curves are present in the diagram",
