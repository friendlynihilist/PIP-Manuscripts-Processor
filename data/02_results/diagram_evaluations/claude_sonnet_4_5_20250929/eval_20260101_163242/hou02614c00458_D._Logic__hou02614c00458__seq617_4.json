  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- The text \"wounded\" is **inside** a closed oval/elliptical curve\n- The text \"man-\" is **outside** any closed curves, positioned to the left\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- There is a **horizontal line** connecting \"man-\" to the oval containing \"wounded\"\n- The line extends from the right end of \"man-\" to the left side of the oval\n- No branching is visible\n- The two text elements appear connected by this single line\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The horizontal line **does cross** the boundary of the oval\n- The line enters the oval from the left side and continues inside toward \"wounded\"\n\n## NESTING:\n- There is only **one closed curve** (the oval) in the diagram\n- No nested curves are present",
