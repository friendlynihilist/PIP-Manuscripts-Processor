  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- **\"respects\"** is contained within a rectangular/rounded rectangular shape\n- **\"man\"** is outside (to the left of) the rectangular shape\n- **\"american\"** is outside (to the right of) the rectangular shape\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects from **\"man\"** to the left side of the rectangle containing \"respects\"\n- A line connects from the right side of the rectangle containing \"respects\" to **\"american\"**\n- The lines appear to flow through or connect to the rectangle in a linear sequence: man → [respects] → american\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- Yes, lines cross the boundaries of the rectangle\n- A line enters the rectangle from the left (from \"man\")\n- A line exits the rectangle to the right (toward \"american\")\n\n## NESTING:\n- There is one main closed curve (a large irregular oval/blob shape) that encompasses the entire diagram\n- The rectangle containing \"respects\" is nested inside this larger outer boundary\n- All text labels (\"man\", \"respects\", \"american\") are contained within the larger outer boundary\n- No other nested relationships exist beyond these two levels",
