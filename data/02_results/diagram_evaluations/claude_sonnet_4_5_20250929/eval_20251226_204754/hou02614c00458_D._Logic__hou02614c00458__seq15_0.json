  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Looking at this image, I can identify the following elements:\n\n## Words/Text:\n1. \"man\" (appears twice - once on the left side and once as part of \"man disgraced\")\n2. \"disgraced\"\n3. \"wounded\"\n\n## Lines/Arcs:\n1. Multiple curved lines forming what appears to be an oval or elliptical boundary\n2. A curved connecting line/arc linking \"man\" to \"wounded\"\n3. A curved connecting line/arc linking elements within the diagram\n\n## Overall Structure:\n- The diagram appears to show a flow or relationship diagram\n- There are approximately **2-3 curved boundary lines** creating nested oval shapes\n- **2-3 connecting arcs/lines** showing relationships between terms\n- **3-4 text elements/words** total\n\n**Summary count:**\n- **Words:** 3-4 (depending on whether you count \"man\" once or twice)\n- **Curved boundary lines:** 2-3\n- **Connecting lines/arcs:** 2-3\n- **Total elements:** Approximately 7-10 distinct elements\n\nThe image appears to be a hand-drawn conceptual diagram showing relationships between the concepts of \"man,\" \"disgraced,\" and \"wounded.\"",
