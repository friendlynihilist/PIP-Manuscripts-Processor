  "prompt": "How many and what kind of elements (e.g., words, lines, arcs, nodes, shapes, etc.) are present in the image?",
  "evaluation": "Looking at this image, I can identify the following elements:\n\n## Words/Text (3):\n1. \"man\" - on the left side\n2. \"disgraces\" - in the upper enclosed area\n3. \"wounded\" - in the lower enclosed area\n\n## Lines (1):\n- One horizontal line extending from \"man\" into the enclosed shape\n\n## Shapes/Enclosures (2):\n- Two curved, irregular oval or bubble-like shapes that contain the words \"disgraces\" and \"wounded\"\n- These appear to be hand-drawn with rough, organic boundaries\n\n## Node/Junction (1):\n- A branching point where the line from \"man\" splits into two paths leading to each enclosed area\n\n**Total: Approximately 7 distinct elements** - 3 words, 1 connecting line, 2 enclosing shapes, and 1 branching node/junction point.\n\nThis appears to be a simple hand-drawn diagram or concept map showing a relationship between \"man\" and two connected concepts.",
