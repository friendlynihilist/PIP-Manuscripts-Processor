  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- **Inside the outer oval**: The text \"man disgraced\" appears at the top\n- **Inside the inner oval**: The text \"wounded\" appears in the middle-lower area\n- **Outside all curves**: The text \"man\" appears on the left side\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects from \"man\" (outside) and branches into two paths\n- One branch leads upward to \"man disgraced\" (inside the ovals)\n- Another branch leads to \"wounded\" (inside the ovals)\n- The branching point occurs at or near where the line crosses into the enclosed areas\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- A line crosses from outside (where \"man\" is located) into the enclosed oval regions\n- This line penetrates both the outer and inner oval boundaries\n\n## NESTING:\n- There are two concentric ovals (one inside the other)\n- The inner oval is nested within the outer oval\n- Both \"man disgraced\" and \"wounded\" are contained within this nested structure",
