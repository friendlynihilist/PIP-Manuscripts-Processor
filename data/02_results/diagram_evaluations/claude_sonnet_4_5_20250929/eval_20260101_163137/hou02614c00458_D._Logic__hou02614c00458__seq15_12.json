  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT\n- The word \"hounded\" is contained inside an oval/elliptical closed curve\n- The word \"mass\" (or similar text) appears to be outside and to the left of the oval\n\n## CONNECTIONS\n- There is a horizontal line that connects the text on the left to the oval on the right\n- The line appears to pass through or connect to the left side of the oval\n- No clear branching is visible in the line structure\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS\n- The horizontal line crosses into the oval boundary from the left side\n- The line appears to continue through or terminate within the oval where it meets the enclosed text\n\n## NESTING\n- There is only one closed curve (the oval) visible\n- No nested curves are present - this is a single-level enclosure",
