  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- **\"man - disgraced\"** is contained within the upper closed curve\n- **\"wounded\"** is contained within the lower closed curve\n- Both text labels remain inside their respective boundaries\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- A vertical line connects the two text labels\n- The line appears to branch in a T-shape or perpendicular junction\n- The vertical line connects \"man - disgraced\" (above) to \"wounded\" (below)\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- Yes, the connecting line crosses between the two closed curves\n- The line enters the upper curve (containing \"man - disgraced\")\n- The line exits and enters the lower curve (containing \"wounded\")\n- The line penetrates both boundary walls\n\n## NESTING:\n- No curves are nested inside one another\n- The two closed curves are stacked vertically\n- They appear to be separate, adjacent regions rather than one inside the other",
