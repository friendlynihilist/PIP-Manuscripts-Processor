  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n\n**Top oval (circled):**\n- Contains the text \"wounded\"\n\n**Middle rounded rectangle:**\n- Contains the text \"disgraced\"\n\n**Bottom rounded shape:**\n- Contains the text \"wounded\"\n\n**Outside all closed curves:**\n- The word \"man\" appears three times as separate labels outside the closed shapes\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n\n- A horizontal line connects from \"man\" (left) to the top oval containing \"wounded\"\n- A horizontal line connects from \"man\" (left) to the middle shape containing \"disgraced\"\n- A curved/angled line connects from \"man\" (left) to the bottom shape containing \"wounded\"\n- All three \"man\" labels on the left appear to originate from approximately the same vertical area\n- No branching structures are evident; each line goes from a \"man\" label to one closed shape\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n\n- The lines connecting \"man\" labels to the closed curves cross into/terminate at the boundaries of their respective shapes\n- No lines pass completely through a shape and exit the other side\n\n## NESTING:\n\n- No closed curves are nested inside other closed curves\n- All three closed shapes are separate and non-overlapping",
