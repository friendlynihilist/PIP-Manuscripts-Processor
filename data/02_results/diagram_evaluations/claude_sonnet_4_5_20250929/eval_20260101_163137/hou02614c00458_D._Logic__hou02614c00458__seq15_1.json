  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Description of the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- **\"disgraces\"** is inside the upper closed curve\n- **\"wounded\"** is inside the lower closed curve\n- **\"man\"** is outside all closed curves (positioned to the left)\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- A line extends from the word **\"man\"** and branches into two paths\n- The branching occurs where the line meets the closed curves\n- One branch connects to the upper curve (containing \"disgraces\")\n- One branch connects to the lower curve (containing \"wounded\")\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The main line from \"man\" approaches the closed curves but the exact crossing point is where the branching occurs\n- The branches appear to terminate at or enter the boundaries of each respective closed curve\n- No lines clearly pass completely through both curves\n\n## NESTING:\n- The two closed curves (containing \"disgraces\" and \"wounded\") appear to be adjacent or overlapping rather than one being nested inside the other\n- Both curves seem to share a common boundary or are very close together on their left side where the branching line meets them\n- Neither curve is completely contained within the other",
