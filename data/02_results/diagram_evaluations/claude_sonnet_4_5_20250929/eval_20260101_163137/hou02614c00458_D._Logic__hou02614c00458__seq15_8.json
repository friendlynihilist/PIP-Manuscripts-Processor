  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- **\"mants d'isgraces\"** - located inside the uppermost elongated closed curve\n- **\"mant\"** - positioned outside all closed curves, to the left\n- **\"mounded\"** - located inside the lower elongated closed curve\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- A curved line connects from the left side, branching into two paths:\n  - One branch extends upward toward the upper closed curve\n  - One branch extends downward toward the lower closed curve\n- The text label **\"mant\"** appears to be positioned near the branching point of these lines\n- No other text labels appear to have direct line connections\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The curved connecting line(s) appear to cross into or touch the boundaries of both closed curves\n- The lines seem to penetrate or merge with the left edges of both elongated shapes\n\n## NESTING:\n- The two main elongated closed curves appear to be separate but overlapping or adjacent to each other\n- There are multiple concentric lines within the upper curve creating a nested effect\n- The curves are not fully nested one inside the other, but rather positioned in a stacked or overlapping arrangement",
