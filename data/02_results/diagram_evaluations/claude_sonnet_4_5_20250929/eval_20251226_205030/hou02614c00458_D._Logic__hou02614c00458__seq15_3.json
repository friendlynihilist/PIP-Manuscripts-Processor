  "prompt": "In Peirce's diagrammatic logic, a closed curve called a cut represents logical negation. Elements inside the same region are interpreted conjunctively (i.e., asserted together). Elements placed directly on the background (the Sheet of Assertion) are considered true. A cut around propositions denies them. Nested cuts represent nested negation. Lines may indicate identity or existential quantification. Based on these principles, interpret the diagram and translate its meaning into a logical statement. If this is not possible, provide a clear explanation in natural language.",
  "evaluation": "Looking at this diagram through the lens of Peirce's Alpha existential graphs:\n\n## Structure Analysis:\n\n1. **Outer cut (large rounded rectangle)**: Contains \"man\" and \"disgraced\"\n2. **Inner cut (nested within the outer)**: Contains \"wounded\"\n3. **Line of identity**: Connects through both regions\n\n## Logical Interpretation:\n\nThe line of identity indicates we're talking about the same individual throughout. Let me trace through the nested negations:\n\n- **\"wounded\"** is inside the inner cut → **¬wounded**\n- This inner cut is inside the outer cut along with \"man\" and \"disgraced\" → **¬(man ∧ disgraced ∧ ¬wounded)**\n\nApplying De Morgan's laws and simplifying:\n¬(man ∧ disgraced ∧ ¬wounded) ≡ ¬man ∨ ¬disgraced ∨ wounded\n\n## Natural Language Translation:\n\n**\"It is not the case that there exists a man who is both disgraced and not wounded.\"**\n\nOr equivalently:\n\n**\"Any man who is disgraced must be wounded.\"**\n\nOr: **\"There is no disgraced man who is unwounded.\"**\n\nThe diagram asserts that the combination of being a man, being disgraced, and being unwounded cannot occur together—implying that disgraced men are (necessarily) wounded.",
