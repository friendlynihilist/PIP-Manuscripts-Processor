  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- The text \"man — wounded\" is contained inside a rounded rectangular shape (speech bubble or banner-like form)\n- No text labels appear outside the closed curve\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- There is an arrow extending from the right end of the rounded rectangle, pointing to the right\n- The arrow appears to be part of or connected to the boundary of the shape itself\n- No separate lines connect different text labels\n- No branching lines are visible\n- The arrow/line does not connect to any other elements (it points outward into empty space)\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The arrow crosses/extends through the right boundary of the rounded rectangle\n- The arrow is integrated into the shape's boundary rather than being a separate crossing element\n\n## NESTING:\n- No closed curves are nested inside others\n- Only one closed curve is present in the diagram",
