  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- \"wounded\" appears to be inside a closed curved boundary\n- \"man\" (left instance) appears to be outside any closed curves\n- \"man\" (bottom instance) appears to be outside any closed curves\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects the left \"man\" label to the closed curve containing \"wounded\"\n- A line extends from the bottom \"man\" label upward toward the closed curve\n- The lines appear to branch or meet at the closed curve boundary\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- Yes, at least one line crosses into the closed curve boundary (the line from the left \"man\" enters the curve)\n- The line from the bottom \"man\" appears to approach or touch the boundary of the closed curve\n\n## NESTING:\n- There appears to be only one main closed curve visible\n- No nested closed curves are evident in this diagram",
