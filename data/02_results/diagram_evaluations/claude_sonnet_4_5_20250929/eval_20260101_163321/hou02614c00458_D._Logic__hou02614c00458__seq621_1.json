  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Description of the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- **Inside the main closed curve (elongated oval/capsule shape):** The text \"catholic\" and \"cadres\" appear on the left side, while \"woman\" appears on the right side\n- **Outside all closed curves:** The text \"woman\" appears to the right of the main shape\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- There is a line connecting \"catholic\" and \"cadres\" to \"woman\" (the one inside the curve)\n- A line extends from \"woman\" (inside) and crosses the boundary, continuing to \"woman\" (outside)\n- There appears to be a small curved or looped element at the top of the diagram\n- The connecting lines show: catholic/cadres → woman (inside) → woman (outside)\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- Yes, a line crosses from inside the main closed curve to outside\n- The line exits through the right side of the main oval shape\n- This line connects the internal \"woman\" label to the external \"woman\" label\n\n## NESTING:\n- There appears to be a smaller closed curve or loop at the top portion of the diagram\n- This smaller element sits above or overlaps with the main elongated oval shape\n- The main capsule/oval shape is the primary boundary, with this smaller curved element positioned at its upper edge",
