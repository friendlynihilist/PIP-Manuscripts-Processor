  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT\n- The text \"Catholic-adored-woman\" is contained within a single closed curve (an irregular oval/rounded rectangle shape)\n- All three hyphenated words are inside the same boundary\n- No text appears outside the closed curve\n\n## CONNECTIONS\n- There are no separate connecting lines between distinct text labels\n- The text appears to be written as one continuous handwritten phrase with hyphens\n- No branching lines are visible\n- No unconnected lines extend from the text\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS\n- No lines cross the boundary of the closed curve\n- The boundary appears complete and uninterrupted\n- The text remains entirely within the enclosed space\n\n## NESTING\n- There is only one closed curve visible\n- No curves are nested inside other curves\n- The diagram consists of a single-level enclosure",
