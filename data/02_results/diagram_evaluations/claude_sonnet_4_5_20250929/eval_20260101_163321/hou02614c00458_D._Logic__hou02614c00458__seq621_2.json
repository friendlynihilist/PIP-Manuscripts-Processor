  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT\n- The text \"catholic + adores woman\" is contained inside a closed oval/elliptical curve\n- All text appears to be within the boundary of this single closed shape\n\n## CONNECTIONS\n- There is a single line extending from the right side of the oval\n- This line branches into what appears to be a Y-shape or fork outside the oval\n- No text labels are directly connected by lines\n- The branching occurs entirely outside the closed curve\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS\n- One line crosses the boundary of the oval, exiting from the right side\n- This is the only boundary crossing visible in the diagram\n\n## NESTING\n- There is only one closed curve visible (the oval)\n- No nested curves are present\n- No closed curves exist inside other closed curves",
