  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- The text \"man 1 wounded.\" is contained inside a rounded rectangle/oval shape\n- The text \"man\" (with a dash after it) appears outside and above the rounded rectangle\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- There is a vertical line extending upward from the rounded rectangle\n- This vertical line connects to or terminates near the word \"man\" (with dash) at the top\n- No branching is visible in the line structure\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- Yes, the vertical line crosses the top boundary of the rounded rectangle\n- The line appears to exit from approximately where the \"1\" character is located within the enclosed text\n\n## NESTING:\n- No nested closed curves are present\n- There is only one closed curve (the rounded rectangle) in the diagram",
