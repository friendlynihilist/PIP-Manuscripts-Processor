  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT\n- The text \"impundlee\" (or similar handwritten text) is contained **inside** a closed oval/elliptical curve\n- No text labels appear outside the closed curve\n\n## CONNECTIONS\n- A horizontal line extends from the **left side** and connects to the oval shape\n- The line appears to pierce through or connect to the left boundary of the oval\n- No branching is visible\n- The line does not connect to any other text or shapes beyond the oval\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS\n- Yes, the horizontal line **crosses into** the left boundary of the oval\n- The line enters the oval from the left side and terminates inside or at the boundary\n\n## NESTING\n- There is only **one closed curve** (the oval) visible\n- No nested curves are present\n- No curves exist inside other curves",
