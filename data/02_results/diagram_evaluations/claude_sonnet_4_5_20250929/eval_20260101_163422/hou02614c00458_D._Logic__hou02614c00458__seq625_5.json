  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- The word \"animal\" is inside the innermost closed curve\n- The word \"rational\" is inside the innermost closed curve (positioned above \"animal\")\n- The word \"man\" is outside all closed curves (positioned to the left)\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- There is a line connecting the word \"man\" to the closed curves\n- This line appears to branch or connect to the boundary where it meets the curves\n- The words \"rational\" and \"animal\" are not connected by lines to each other\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line extending from \"man\" crosses into/through the boundary of the outer closed curve\n- The line appears to penetrate through to or toward the inner region where \"rational\" and \"animal\" are located\n\n## NESTING:\n- Yes, there are nested closed curves\n- There is an inner closed curve that contains \"rational\" and \"animal\"\n- There is an outer closed curve that encompasses the inner curve\n- The curves appear to be roughly oval or irregular rounded shapes",
