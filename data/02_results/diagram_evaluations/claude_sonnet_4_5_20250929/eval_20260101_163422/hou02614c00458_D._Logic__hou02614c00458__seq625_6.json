  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- The word \"animal\" is contained within the innermost closed curve\n- The word \"man\" is outside all closed curves (to the left)\n- The partial word/prefix \"natural\" appears to be contained within a middle closed curve\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- There is a line connecting \"man\" to the closed curves\n- This line appears to branch or fork, with one branch crossing through toward \"natural\" and another branch connecting to \"animal\"\n- The branching point occurs at or near the boundary of the curves\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- Yes, the line from \"man\" crosses through the boundaries of the closed curves\n- The line penetrates from outside (where \"man\" is located) into the interior regions\n\n## NESTING:\n- Yes, there are nested closed curves\n- There appear to be at least 2-3 concentric oval/elliptical curves\n- The innermost curve contains \"animal\"\n- A middle curve appears to contain \"natural\"\n- The outermost curve encompasses both inner regions",
