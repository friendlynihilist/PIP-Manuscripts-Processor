  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Description of the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- **Top closed curve**: Contains the text \"man\" and \"animal\"\n- **Bottom closed curve**: Contains the text \"man\" and \"rational\"\n- Both curves are elongated ovals with multiple concentric outlines\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- **Top curve**: A line connects \"man\" to \"animal\" (moving left to right)\n- **Bottom curve**: A line connects \"man\" to \"rational\" (moving left to right)\n- No branching is visible\n- The two curves/systems appear independent of each other (no lines connecting between them)\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- No lines cross the boundaries of the closed curves\n- All connecting lines remain entirely within their respective closed curves\n\n## NESTING:\n- No closed curves are nested inside others\n- The two oval shapes are stacked vertically, one above the other\n- Each curve is independent and separate from the other",
