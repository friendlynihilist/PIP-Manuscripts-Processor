  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- The text \"rational\" is inside a closed curve (oval/rounded rectangle)\n- The text \"animal\" is inside the same closed curve\n- The text \"man\" is outside the closed curve, positioned to the left\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- A horizontal line connects from the word \"man\" \n- This line branches into two parts that connect to both \"rational\" and \"animal\"\n- The branching occurs at a point where the line meets or enters the closed curve\n- \"rational\" and \"animal\" are not directly connected to each other by lines\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- Yes, the line extending from \"man\" crosses into the boundary of the closed curve\n- The line appears to penetrate the left side of the oval/rounded rectangle\n\n## NESTING:\n- There is only one closed curve visible\n- No nested curves are present\n- \"rational\" and \"animal\" share the same single boundary",
