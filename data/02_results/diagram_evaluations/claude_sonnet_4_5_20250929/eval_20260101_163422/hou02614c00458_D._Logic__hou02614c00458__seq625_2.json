  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- **Top closed curve**: Contains the text \"fears\" and \"snake\" (with \"snake\" positioned to the right)\n- **Bottom closed curve**: Contains the text \"hates\" and \"snake\" (with \"snake\" positioned to the right)\n- **Outside all curves**: The text \"man\" appears to the left of the closed curves\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- A line connects \"man\" to both closed curves at their left edges (branching point)\n- Inside the top curve: a line connects \"fears\" to \"snake\"\n- Inside the bottom curve: a line connects \"hates\" to \"snake\"\n- The word \"fears\" has a strikethrough line crossing it horizontally\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- The line from \"man\" crosses into both closed curves at their left boundaries\n- The connecting lines between text labels (fears→snake, hates→snake) remain within their respective curves\n\n## NESTING:\n- No closed curves are nested inside others\n- The two elongated oval/rounded rectangular curves are positioned parallel to each other (top and bottom arrangement)\n- Both curves are at the same hierarchical level",
