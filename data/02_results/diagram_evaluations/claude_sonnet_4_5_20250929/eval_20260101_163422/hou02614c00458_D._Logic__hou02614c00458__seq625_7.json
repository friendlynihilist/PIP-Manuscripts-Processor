  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT\n- The word \"unrounded\" is contained inside a rounded rectangular outline/capsule shape\n- No text labels appear outside the closed curve\n\n## CONNECTIONS\n- There is a single horizontal line extending from the left side of the rounded rectangle\n- This line connects to the left edge of the capsule shape containing \"unrounded\"\n- No branching lines are present\n- No other separate or unconnected lines exist\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS\n- The horizontal line from the left crosses into/meets the boundary of the rounded rectangular shape\n- No lines cross completely through and exit the other side of the boundary\n\n## NESTING\n- There is only one closed curve (the rounded rectangle)\n- No closed curves are nested inside others\n- The diagram consists of a single-level enclosure",
