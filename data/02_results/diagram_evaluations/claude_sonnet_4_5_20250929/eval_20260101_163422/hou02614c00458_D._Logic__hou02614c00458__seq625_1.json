  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT\n\n**Top oval:**\n- Contains the text \"fears\" and \"hates\"\n- \"snake\" is outside this oval, to the right\n\n**Bottom oval:**\n- Contains the text \"fears\" and \"hates\"\n- \"snake\" is outside this oval, to the right\n\n**\"man\":**\n- Located outside both ovals, to the left\n\n## CONNECTIONS\n\n- A line connects \"man\" to a branching point\n- From this branching point, two lines extend:\n  - One line goes to the top oval\n  - One line goes to the bottom oval\n- Inside each oval, there appears to be a line connecting \"fears\" and \"hates\"\n- A line extends from each oval to its respective \"snake\" label on the right\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS\n\n- The line from \"man\" crosses into both ovals at their left boundaries\n- Lines exit each oval on the right side, connecting to \"snake\"\n\n## NESTING\n\n- The two ovals are NOT nested inside each other\n- They are positioned one above the other\n- Both ovals appear to be at the same hierarchical level",
