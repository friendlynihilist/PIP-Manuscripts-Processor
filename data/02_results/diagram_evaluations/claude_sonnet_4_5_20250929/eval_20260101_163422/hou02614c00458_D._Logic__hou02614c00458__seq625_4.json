  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT\n\n**Innermost closed curve (smallest oval):**\n- Contains: \"hates\"\n\n**Middle closed curve (medium oval):**\n- Contains: \"fears\" and \"hates\" (the entire innermost oval is contained within this one)\n\n**Outermost closed curve (largest oval):**\n- Contains: \"snake\", \"fears\", and \"hates\" (both inner ovals are contained within this one)\n\n**Outside all closed curves:**\n- \"man\" appears to the left, outside all ovals\n\n## CONNECTIONS\n\n- A straight horizontal line connects \"man\" on the left to \"snake\" on the right\n- This line passes through all the nested ovals\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS\n\n- The horizontal line connecting \"man\" to \"snake\" crosses through:\n  - The outermost oval boundary (enters and exits)\n  - The middle oval boundary (enters and exits)\n  - The innermost oval boundary (enters and exits)\n- The line crosses a total of 6 boundary points (3 entry points and 3 exit points)\n\n## NESTING\n\n- Three levels of nesting exist:\n  1. Innermost: small oval containing \"hates\"\n  2. Middle: medium oval containing \"fears\" and the innermost oval\n  3. Outermost: large oval containing \"snake\" and both inner ovals",
