  "prompt": "Describe the spatial relationships in this diagram.\n\nCONTAINMENT: Which text labels are inside or outside each closed curve?\nCONNECTIONS: Which text labels are connected by lines? Note any branching or unconnected lines.\nBOUNDARY CROSSINGS: Do any lines cross the boundaries of closed curves?\nNESTING: Are any closed curves nested inside others?\n\nDo not interpret meaning. Only describe what you see spatially.",
  "evaluation": "# Spatial Relationships in the Diagram\n\n## CONTAINMENT:\n- **Inside the closed curve**: The text \"man wounded\" appears to be contained within the large, irregular closed curve\n- **Outside the closed curve**: The text \"many\" is positioned outside and to the left of the closed curve\n\n## CONNECTIONS:\n- There is a curved line that connects from the word \"many\" (outside) and extends into the closed curve region\n- This connecting line appears to branch or merge with the boundary of the closed curve\n- The line seems to point toward or connect near the text \"man wounded\"\n\n## BOUNDARY CROSSINGS:\n- Yes, the line originating from \"many\" crosses the boundary of the closed curve\n- The line penetrates from outside the curve into the interior space\n\n## NESTING:\n- No nested closed curves are visible\n- There is only one main closed curve (an irregular, roughly oval or blob-like shape)\n- No smaller curves exist inside this main curve",
